We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,2019-10-29 20:22:02
1,plr86v,Regular check-in post with a note about our reformatted rules,370,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/plr86v/regular_checkin_post_with_a_note_about_our/,912,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

*****

We'd also like to draw your attention to our reformatted rules at  /r/depression/about/rules, which we soft-launched a few months ago.  As part of that, we developed two detailed wikis with lots of reference information.  

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance on how -- and how not -- to offer help and support here.  

YSK that the types of rule violations that cause us the most trouble here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule.  You should never trust *anyone* who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here.  See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact 

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity.  The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.  

* General-interest posts, or posts about causes or issues.  All these are either off topic (rule 1) or activism (rule 10).  

* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts.  This is an expert-free zone -- that's what *peer support* means (rule 5).  We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions.  Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.  

* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses.  Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.  The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression,2021-09-11 00:24:40

You'd think that after finally getting an autism diagnosis I would finally get the help I need. The help I actually need. I'm not 18 yet, I'm forced to get support from my family still. 

My mom's idea of help is basically just pretend the problems aren't fucking there. As long as nobody can tell you're suffering, then that's fine by her. 

She doesn't care that I'm depressed, or lonely, bored out of my mind, struggling with what could possibly be the start of an eating disorder (surprise, I fucking hate eating now because of how she talks about me), and nearly tried to kill myself a few weeks ago. 

All she cares is that I get to school on time, and I start passing my classes. Basically she's saying ""I don't care your anxiety prevents you from going to school, just do it."" She told me she wants me to graduate, not for my sake, but for her sake. So I ""don't turn out like her"" and so I don't graduate at the same year as my cousin who is a year younger than me. Good to know she's still comparing me to my fucking cousin like she did in 6th grade when I had constant panic attacks. ""Why can't you just be like her and stop crying all the time?!"" Now it's ""I'm making your graduation a competition against my brother and completely disregarding your mental health.""

Depression and anxiety are the problem here, not my dumb fucking grade on an electronic website. Not my fucking GPA. Not me showing up to school 30 minutes late every day. My 1st period teacher knows I have anxiety, and the school gives me an IEP/504 due to anxiety and autism. I can't be punished for my tardies. Somehow the school understands shit better than my mom. 

Every single year since 6th grade I've promised myself I'll do better ""this next upcoming schedule year."" I want to do better. I wanna be a fucking normal person. I'm trying to push myself, but then I get no help and within a month of school I lose motivation and the ability to focus and my grades plummet.

Oh, and it wouldn't be a parent handling their child's depression horribly without punishment for being depressed. My depression causes my bad grades, I get punished for bad grades, and it makes me depressed. I don't even think I'd care about getting punished if she at least fucking TRIED to support me.

Like, ""the hardest working student"", ""the tech wizard"" and then there was ""the one who outdid themselves (doesn't translate well)"". Well, I won that one. 

I was basically praised most of the night and people were like ""I remember how shy you were at first and now you you light up the room with your positivity and kindness"" and ""I don't know how you're able to get along with everyone so well"" and the list goes on. Bullshit. 

This positive person has severe depression, I'm a self-harming drug addict who wishes to die every other day and thinks about suicide once a week. That's posivity for you alright haha

I also know a few others that are like me. They always smile and are friendly but have all tried to kill themselves many times. 

I guess I just find it interesting how good people are at faking it. It really goes to show that no one knows jack shit.

I planned my death. I've tried to do it before, but found myself too scared to finish writing. This time was different. This time, I didn't feel shameful after writing it. I didn't rip up the page and burn it like I do with every other negative writing I do.

I have it in my desk right now. I'm staring at it from my bed, thinking about the changes I may make to the plan.

There is a part of me that is terrified to follow through. That part used to be just a little stronger than the part that constantly wants to die, but I can barely hear it now.

I'm 22, I make 3x the average salary in my country, live comfortably, for the most part enjoy my work (but do really enjoy the field I work in), save a lot of money, travel occasionally, buy most things I want or need. Just had a pretty good relationship that just ended, though these feelings existed during the relationship already. 

And yet I still feel so empty inside. Few things bring me happiness anymore. The world seems surrealist, I can't take anything seriously, we're all just carbon atoms going wild and doing random shit, the world is going to be fucked in 20 years anyway so what's the point of doing anything? It's like the relationship I just had. Why not end it while we're ahead and things aren't quite as desperate?

Those thoughts lead me to thinking about killing myself. Around half of the days of the week I think of what methods are best. Slowly getting to a point where I wake up and first thing think of killing myself, ruining the day and disrupting my work. I'd hate what it would do to my family and loved ones so I kind of dissuade myself with that. I feel guilty that I'm ""supposed"" to be happy because of my achievements, that I'm healthy etc and I want to throw all of this away.

Thinking the only way for me to feel unbridled happiness would be succesfully building my startup with my cofounder (which will take tons of mental energy, is most likely to fail, and wrecks mentally very healthy people), or spending my savings on heroin or other hard drugs that make you feel good, and when I run out, hanging myself. Don't really know other things, that can be bought with money or otherwise, that would have the same effect.

I've been going through a breakup. My ex was a toxic guy who disrespected me, insulted me and took advantages of my true feelings to get what he wanted. In the end,I was the only one truly in love. 

I'm better than before but I still cry sometimes during the night and weekend. But now I can eat normally and live ,just the crying still there but hopefully will spaced and one day I won't cry so much anymore from the pain of the breakup and all the terrible things he did and said to me.

In my life, all I ever wanted was to meet good people who would be kind to me as I am to them,and that wanted me in their life and love me for who I am.

But all I met was people who abandoned me to have cooler friends, then pretending they know me with their new friends. Or people who said I'm their friend but its always me who take news of them ,so in the end I stopped taking news because a relationship is a two way road.

And last years,I've only met a few people and it's the same. Including my ex. I was happy to have finally someone who loves me but it ended badly and it was not genuine.

The other encounters were weird people or mean people so I cut off any contact.

It's been years,and I haven't met one single person who want me in their life and love me as I am.

I still hope that one day, eventually I will meet my true love and at least one true friend but that time seems far. It's been over 10 years I' have been trying to make friends but to no avail.

I've spent like over half of my life like this, without true friends (I wasn't even searching for love). You can guess my age ,yeah I'm still young but years are passing by

I wanna be happy without the need of anyone but I'm human, I need social interaction, I want to be loved and accepted as a person,I'm fed up of being abandoned ,of loving people and want them in my life but its never reciprocated

That lack of social life ,no social at all,has been affecting me for many years. I've tried too many things to meet people but here people aren't opened at all or old people I met only.

The more we age ,the more it's difficult to meet new people too. All I met was old people at work  (over 20 years of gap and even 50 sometimes)

I wanna have at least just one person to hang out, that takes news from me. Saying hi wassup. Not everyday, maybe just once or month or more ,but just someone who cares about me.

The most depressing thing is that I HAVE tried to meet people. But they just stay in their group or they are narrow minded . Hopefully I will meet nice people one day


Life is hard without love. I have a family but that's not the same.
I wanna travel one day on my own ,maybe I might meet open minded people,but right now isn't the right time as I don't have any money


All I want is to be happy,like anybody. 

I wonder if i will ever find true love ,and true friendship.

I’ve fucked up multiple times with her because of alcohol, so I got rid of it definitely ( 4months sober now and I can’t care less ). Relation between me and her went sour so we brokeup but kept seeing each other, thinking we could maybe work things out.

I'm facing with depression for 8 years (I'm 21) and in the state of treatment by psychiatrist  almost 1 and half years (taking med, making appointment to check my mental health and give advice to cope with my feelings).

I'm studying in Arts and need to do research article for my degree (compulsory subject) about literature or language's linguistic. Of course it stressful and make my life in loop like reading research , take note, present your title and idea to professor and getting reject or revise the title over and over in a time limit of 1 semester.

And I'm kind of high awareness to people even in uni. I could say that i have only 1 who I can truly say ""friend"" and we're helping each other for almost 2 years. we're the same like not open to someone heart that easy, thinking in the same way almost everything etc.

The problem is my only friend need to think over the title of the research again and she's just move to research about linguistic when nearly need to present the Idea and Literature review to professor. 

(she determined to go for literature at first but they're lot of research about it and need more knowledge to study in new aspects which is over hand of our degree, Also the literature's professor is kind of make her uncomfortable) 

So she's busy and in the stressful state, which is keeping it alone and not like the past year that I can help her in someway even mental support but now she's not asking for anything. that make me feel distance from her.

tldr: My only best friend busy when I feel like I need someone in this state that I could barely dealing with my depression and make me feel insecure about this situation.

I know this story sound stupid. like ""easy just getting through it.""

I know, I understand the situation and everything 

My brain can accept it and everything make sense

Only my heart it's feel like I'm not important anymore

And it feel empty... and people around me also busy, no one could be my ear.

I know everything is impermanent, sadness and happiness too.

But when I'm getting happy everything looks great,

The depression will raise over the happiness and ruin it over and over

I'm afraid that I can't get through this situation anymore.

I'm afraid of Depression could take control of myself and do the thing that my other self want to do it for 8 years.

I’ve been working very hard on saving money for the car of my dreams. Days after spending a large sum on a deposit for a car, 3 appliances broke in my house I have no money to fix them. I can’t get the money back and I’m going to have to sell everything I love just to make it work. And probably sell the car immediately. 

I used to be a social butterfly but I have shut myself out of all social life that I have one friend that I still talk to. Outside of that I have no one anymore.

Another thing that really lowers my mental health is how unaccepting my family is. I support BLM, they believe in ALM.  I’m a part of the lgbtqia+ community, they’re all homophobic and transphobic. My belief differ so much from theirs, that I’m always teamed up against in arguments.  I keep having self harm thoughts, but I refuse to listen since I’m around 4 months clean at this point.

First she presented it as a break to see what we feel like by ourselves, we've been together pretty much 24/7 since covid started and it's been difficult at times.

But after a lot of crying and talking, it turns out she wants to break up. She was trying to go easy on me and wanted to give me a chance to work on myself and build up my confidence.
She did this because she knows I don't have anyone else and she's my whole world.

I was still living in the apartment with her until earlier tonight, I was a complete wreck. I can't sleep and barely eat, cried more than I have ever in my life. And it's torture to be around her acting like we're just friends.

Earlier tonight I found out she's been talking to a guy online. I shouldn't have looked at her phone but I knew something was up cause of the way she's acted these past months, it just clicked for me at that point and I had to know for sure.

Essentially this guy is helping her through our breakup and they're flirting with each other at the same time, and the way they talked about me is like I'm an inconvenience.

I confronted her and she said things that hurt a lot.
She doesn't love me because I'm not an assertive type of guy. She said we're too similar and she needs to be with someone who is a ""leader"" that can motivate her.
She was planning to try it with this other guy this whole time, but she wanted to break up with me first rather than cheat on me, and she wanted to grab the opportunity of being with someone better.

I couldn't be around her so now I'm alone in a hotel room at 5 in the morning. I've just been sitting on the bed for hours trying to process this.

I'm living my worst nightmare. I never thought anything like this would come from her.
I feel completely worthless and I've lost my best friend, the only person I ever could really connect with.
I hate that I still love her and that I'm sitting here hoping for a text from her.

When I wont have sex with him or give him anything. The reason he does is because I'm kind of trapped. I have no money saved to move away and my credit is shot. No one or nowhere to turn to. Ij pray I can hustle enough to make something happen sooner than later.I am exhausted physically and mentally and I don't know when to stop worrying.

When my boyfriend and I first started dating his sex drive was pretty strong. Any time I came over he would practically attack me as soon as I got in the door. Then he switched from Wellbutrin to Lexapro and his sex drive was nearly non-existent. I almost always initiated and often he would struggle to climax or maintain an erection. He has since switched back to Wellbutrin and a lot of things are improving. I can tell his sex drive is starting to return, but it isn’t what it was. He is week 7 into 300 MG of Wellbutrin XL. He completely stopped Lexapro in week 4. Is it realistic to expect his drive will return to what it was? Thank you all in advance.",depression,2021-12-09 09:47:21

I'm extremely unworthy. For 4 fucking years, I've never been able to get a job because they only hire people that have work history and experience. No matter what job it is, that's what's expected all the time. For 9 years, I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. As I get older, I feel more miserable existing in a world where a lot of bullshit happens. I'm not too worried about being hated or being alone as it's fine with me. I just find it confusing when people pretend to give a fuck about me. If someone doesn't want me around and can't stand me, just let me know. At least I'd know what to do at that moment. I'm not happy to know that I have to work for assholes for the rest of my life whilst losing out on your own time. On top of that, I have to continue being in a place where I don't fucking belong and deal with bullshit that people can create without consequence. I'm only good for being a fuck up and having the inability to cope. I hate having live. It's not fun at all. I'd rather be dead than being a human having to suck up to whatever societal expectations that's expected of me. I hate people mostly because of their character and how they go about things. There are good people that exist, but dickheads are mostly common as people are very good at pretending to give a shit in order to gain something for themselves. I hate talking about how I really feel everyday because it doesn't do anything and causes issues, mostly consisting of guilt trip and drama. 

I no longer have the energy to pretend I'm fine as I've been trying to for so many years. I'm unlikable and unlovable in many ways possible. I'm ugly as fuck and will never amount to shit. The only way I'd really be happy is for me to be dead. I failed to hang myself many times because I couldn't do it properly. If I was dead, I don't have to talk anymore, no longer worrying about work, having to eat/drink, no longer be expected to do anything, no longer having to exist, no longer how to look at anything or match any criteria to be classed as a regular person etc. Since I can't morph into an object or animal, death is my only answer. I'm not made for this world. There's nothing to care or love about me. I'm a fucking disgrace. Everyday, I'm fucking agitated that I have to wake up. I don't enjoy being a human being overall. It's super draining. Especially as a black man because it's always expected that they have to man up all the time without having any breakdowns regardless. I often feel like shit having to be a man because society doesn't truly give a fuck about them. There's far too much evidence to prove what men have to face. It's good that people try to tackle problems that women face, but why couldn't men also be included in that? Men and women may have differences, but the one thing we have in common is that we are humans. As I've only had true love once, I know I can never truly experience that again, so I'd rather stay single than to fail to be an ideal person for someone. I also think it's best to stay alone as being depressed and suicidal is stigmatised in reality. Anytime someone reveals how they actually feel within themselves, they will eventually be burned out from it and will be very bothered by the person that is truly melancholic. I've tried being happy for a long time, but realised years ago that I can't really be happy in this world. If someone wants to help me die, that would be appreciated. I'm not cut out for this shit. If I were able to give my health to someone who truly needs it, I would do so. I don't deserve anything at all apart from death.",depression,2021-12-09 09:19:41

I hit one of the lowest hardest times in my life about 6 years ago. I cried every day and was having a couple panic attacks each week, even with an antidepressant. I started seeing a therapist and life changed. I was doing so much better. I stopped smoking wed every day to avoid life. And I started to be romantic with guys. 

I realized I keep falling into the same pattern with men that I just give and give so that they will like me. Especially in the bedroom. I was so unfulfilled and unhappy. Soon I realized my antidepressant was causing sexual side effects. I stopped my antidepressant, but the problem was still there. 

It must be because I’ve always been with guys who are selfish. I keep giving so they keep taking. They must not be paying enough attention to me. I found a guy who pays tons of attention to me, and the problem is still there. 

I don’t know how to let someone be nice to me. I don’t know how to relax and enjoy someone’s attention on me. 

I work in the mental health field. I know I never learned to trust other people or look to them for support and help as a child, so the problem is still there.

To be fair, I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Very rarely I get excited by events, but I do not make much of an effort to have a pleasant experience.

What become apparent to me tonight as I was showering was that I always have low energy and that I am never hyped up or ""give gas.""

So I started to think about all the nice things I value and want to achieve one after the other in an extremely fast and freakish way and then I started talking to myself out loud, sometimes even screaming, and at the same time trying to feel the emotions as strongly as I could. 

It became apparent to me that this is something I used to have and I am missing. To put it simply: energy. 

I think it is time for me to put a lot of effort and, in a sense, generate energy by talking to myself, getting loud and start moving my body somewhat.

In that moment as I was fantasizing, I felt alive and like my life had meaning. A fire in me has been reignited, a fire that I was so afraid of setting because of the fear I will hit rock bottom again and all of my efforts have been for nothing.

Well, it turns out, the effort has not been for nothing and will never have be for nothing. It is something my depressed mind convinced me when all positivity was blurred and blocked out.

And if I hit bottom, so be it! I am learning my lesson as I go and I will do all in my power to create a habit so strong, that I will jump right back out of this shit hole.

I think this is what all other regular people do and we have, in a sense, forgot and lost our way from climbing back up to the top.

I may not be the smartest, I may not get things right on point as I always wished, I may not be superhuman and do things no-one could ever think of but that is fine. To achieve something other-worldly and inhuman, you would have to be a bit insane and that is something I have had enough of, and just want to live out life as happy and as fulfilled as I can be while letting all other notions that have come to fruition over overthinking fade back away into my psyche.

A graphic but real post,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rc9lvd/im_disgusted_a_graphic_but_real_post/,0,"If you’re easily grossed out, this isn’t for you. I’m so embarrassed and disgusted with myself for allowing this to happen but proud that i got it done today. I will give a bit of background but the graphic part is the bottom.

I’m 27 years old. For 19 years i lived as a “normal” person. I was happy, fearless, intelligent . Then summer of 2015, (July 2nd, yes i remember) i got this numb feeling. It shocked me so much and happened twice so i went to the ER. They found nothing but i got worst that night and went again. I learned i had anxiety attacks and then i eventually had surgeries for my allergies plus allergy shots & gastro issues. This went on for awhile and i ended up taking online classes that fall. Also in July of that year, my aunt passed out of no where. Everything sucked & i started having sleep apnea and paralysis. TERROR and made me have anxiety about sleep too!

I had some hard years and gained a ton of weight but my anxiety started to lessen around 2017. I got pregnant but as a black woman, i couldn’t handle being another statistic of a single mother. I knew the man i was with didn’t care that much & i didn’t want to but decided to have an abortion. Around late 2019 through 2020, i started getting better depression wise. I started losing weight and eating better. I started to get dressed more outside of work and taking care of myself as i used to. I see such a dark cloud and waste of my years from 2015-2019. 

Now, since 2016ish, I’ve been financially successful and able to mask the sadness. I would work a lot and let myself disappear and wallow on days off. But money is nothing when you can’t enjoy yourself & feel time passing you by. So this year i got a new job with a pay cut but more time off! Great right? NO! Lol, more time off for me means more time for my brain to be idle. More time for me to be lazy and wallow. More depression. 


Around July of this year my life fell apart in every way. I had a business so i stopped working… because i wanted to figure me out . For lots of reasons , i paused the business with the partner. I was tired of people using me for money, i don’t mind helping but when you’re a giver, people take advantage. Idc about the $, it’s the way they barely ask if you’re okay. You don’t hear from them until then. I got tired of dead end relationships. I allowed the way others treated me to lower my self esteem and self worth. I felt like nothing.  For the first time in my life, i gave up on everything… even myself. I give and help in any way i can, for ANYONE…& I’d give anything to have someone just care. 

I sit in my luxury apartment, prime location, and feel alone. When i worked, I’d come home to myself. I’m shy so hard to connect with but funny enough I’m actually a funny, pretty & intelligent girl but I’m introverted. Money is nothing when you’re alone. So tmi but here i go… the last 6 weeks, i have done nothing. Barely bathed. Left my phone on DND.. barely left the bed. I know my body well but was shocked when my period came on because the days flew by. When i did eat, i ordered food. I didn’t take the trash out nor use valet trash. Couldn’t be bothered. I started smelling the trash and hearing gnats. i saw a few. I got up today and was working on things outside of the house but taking a bag at a time before running erands … i looked down and saw larvae. I was disgusted. I just finished taking everything out …freaking out because i am terrified of bugs lol. I waited because i wants my neighbors to mostly be inside lol. I was too embarrassed to allow valet trash to help or see me. I’m so disgusted i allowed myself to let this happen. I’m sad i had 19 years of life and 8 years I’ve been  emotionally dead. I didn’t ask for this. It isn’t fair to know what it’s like to be normal and lose it. I’m scheduling an appt to get help. I can’t do this alone & i just want to have my life back.  I was so numb that i didn’t care to live anymore…i cursed God for not helping me. How could he do this me? 

I’m in the lowest season of my life, no contact with anyone..i stopped talking to everyone to figure me out . Seasons pass though so i hope to come out stronger for spring . This is my winter diary ♥️ depression is the dumbest of bitches…",depression,2021-12-09 09:57:32

Lonliness can occur when you're literally -- alone -- but also when you feel alone in your experience. Depression for me has always been typified by a deep sense of isolation. And what's worse, is that when I am deeply depressed, the few people I have in my life want to be further separated from me. I'm not fun to be around. So of course, I then feel even more isolated and disregarded. Sometimes I want to say to the people in my life, ""I could be dead,"" to try to make them remember why it is that they love me. But I know that this can make certain relationships overly complicated at best and co-dependent at worst. So it's a positive-feedback loop... a spiral. Also, a chicken-or-the-egg question of, ""was I depressed first or lonely?"" 

At our core, humans remain tribal, family-oriented beings. All human action is performed to ultimately be received by another human, even in the most indirect way.. Depression for me feels like a physical disconnection from my human need for connection to others. Although I often describe it more as a void -- a dark emptiness that captures everything with meaning and either obliterates it or transforms it into shards of glass that fly back at me to inflict a sharp pain. The pain is a real pain of being separated from the pack. When we are alone for too long, our biology starts working against us.. That being said, I don't know if people with depression can simply turn to other members of their ""tribe"" to help pull them out of it. But I think interacting with other people who have or are experiencing depression MIGHT help fill that basic need for connection. I've never tried group therapy, but I'd imagine it would be useful in filling this need. This thread is a useful (somewhat impersonal) form in a way. Certain drugs are maybe useful in this regard through connection to the collective unconscious or extending understandings of sentience beyond the human realm. 

But in the least, being seen and heard by another human being can be immensely healing. Or on the flip-side, seeing or hearing another person's story can also do this. I think this is something innate to being human. Since all human activity is interconnected, we derive meaning from one another. And this is why I think this page can be so useful, too. 

All this to say... for me, depression is inextricably linked to lonliness. Whether that's because depression leads to lonliness (lonliness in the world or as an internal experience) or lonliness that leads to depression. I'm curious if you have a similar connection.

Thanks for reading all this.",depression,2021-12-09 09:50:07

At first, there were not really any reasons, but this year I have been really overthinking and crying for some things. I also cannot sleep. And I came to the decision that I must move on as soon as possible and be adequate.  
 I struggle over the fact that depression affects our bodies and brains and I wondered if it had affected me with the things I mentioned above and marked in a bright text. Maybe this sounds naive or inadequate, but if I don't make sure I know, then I will stay with my worries.  


 I started crying from myself back then, but it was surprising, so I tried several times again. This sounds pretty stupid and what person on Earth would try to cry, well I did not know what depression was, and my ""ability"" to cry turned worse with each year.

Once I stop the medication the shortness of breath feeling goes away. Currently on 15mg of mirtazapine and do not experience the shortness of breath but if I go over the 15mg of mirtazapine the feeling of SOB comes back.

my name is Bruno, I'm twenty-two years old and I'm from Argentina. This year has been a nosedive for me and I don't see an encouraging future. I had problems with my ex partner who made the decision to move away from me. As a result of that bad relationship, I became a controlling, toxic person and ended up in the psychiatric hospital twice, due to crises that have led to suicide attempts and self-flagellation. This year I graduated from a career that I am not passionate about, I do not see myself working in it, I have many insecurities about it and its difficult for me to admit it. I signed up for a programming course, which I am taking after my first hospitalization, but I have many doubts about it. I don't know if I'm taking advantage of this learning, because every day I feel depressed. Also, the course is not cheap at all. I am currently taking psychotropic drugs every day; I must confess that I do not always comply with taking the pills. I have been to the psychologist but I feel that she is not helping me, I do not get answers and I continue with my bad habits. Let's mention that I live alone. That many times I don't eat. I go to bed and get up late (my day usually starts at 2:00 PM / 3:00 PM). In the middle of this mess I became an active user of marijuana and every two or three days I buy, because they make my problems dissolve for a while. I'm very afraid of the future, because I think its black. I started thinking about suicide more often. I imagine how I could kill myself. In addition to the final distance my ex decided to take, other friends have distanced themselves from me. I can't help but think that I am a problem to everyone who interacts with me. I don't have motivation to continue living. I cry every day because I miss my ex, and he has already completely forgotten about me. I can't help but want to know what he does, who he sees. I feel like, in a year that we were together, I really didn't get to know him, and that hurts a lot. On the other hand, I'm not someone close to my family, who also lives in another city. My mother wants to get closer to me, but I'm ashamed to show me what I am to her. I can't forge a close relationship with her, I just can't, and it breaks my heart to see her sad.

I am just so, so tired of being unhappy. I have never not felt the way I do, and I can’t bear the thought of having to do it for the rest of my life. But I love my family and I know that if I were to kill myself then I would ruin their lives too, and I don’t want to do that.

So I wake up every morning and just exist. I don’t live, I just… go through the motions and try to pretend that I might one day finally understand what it feels like to be happy, and shake off this big black cloud of total despondence and walk in the sun. But I never will.

I’ve done everything you’re supposed to do. Seen therapists, taken medication, exercised, eaten healthily, turned to loved ones for support, even gotten myself an ADHD diagnosis. But nothing has worked. 

I think about dying, and death, every single day. Genuinely. It’s like this ultimate fantasy, this idea I could just go to sleep and be peaceful and not feel this way. And then I think about how I can’t do that to my family, and just fucking cry about the prospect I have to live out this shitty, worthless life. 

I don’t have any talents. I’m not interesting, or pretty. I’m not clever, or successful. I don’t have much money or savings. I don’t have any passions, or ever feel excited about anything. I find being around people - even the people I love - exhausting, and I wish to god I didn’t. I don’t think I’ll ever “find love”, as much as I want to, because I’m cursed to not enjoy anything physical, and hate being in someone’s company all the time. I hate having to talk, and go outside, and think of ways to socialise with people. I feel old, ugly, “past my peak”, a failure, invisible. Nobody thinks highly of me. I get sympathy, and even support, but as my friends move forward with their lives with weddings and houses and new jobs, they thank god they’re not me. 

I wish I wasn’t me. 

I have nobody to talk to. I have friends and family, but I can’t talk to them. My parents have always made out that the way I feel is a consequence of some failing of mine. “It’ll go away if you exercise” “it’s because you’re single” “it’s because you don’t have kids”. It’s not. It’s not. There is something wrong with me, and having people suggest it’s just another result of my own failings hurts me even more. None of that matters, or will ever help. I can’t tell my friends how I really feel, because they have their own problems and lives to live. And nobody wants the perpetual rain cloud. Therapists have never worked. They never ask how I am, or just let me talk. It’s all visualisation exercises and CBT that just doesn’t work for me. 

I just want to talk. I want to not feel so tired. I want to not have to live the rest of my life. I want to be anyone but me. 

But I’m stuck. And my life will always be empty.",depression,2021-12-08 07:53:17

I rode my bike, went swimming, even went to competitions for it. I had friends i cared about and i was getting through school just fine. 

It all changed in 2019, when i started feeling miserable, unmotivated and sad all the time. My sleep schedule got fucked, i barely had any sleep and that just complicated it more. I was alone most of 2020 and felt neutral, not happy but also not sad, it was calm and peaceful.

I met her in early 2021, and she shined so bright, i forgot about everything that bothered me, i thought she cured me. And for a time, she did, she really did. I loved her and still do very very much and i'm very thankful for the time she gave me. But she left. And i became a husk again. I know it wasn't a good idea to place everything in her, i know i should have used the blessing of happiness she gave me to improve myself and find my own happiness, but i didn't. She tried so much to get me up, but she didn't suceed. I regret it every single day. I just wish i wasn't such a worthless piece of shit, i wish i was able to give her the same thing she gave me. She meant and still means the world to me, and i'm really sad i can't make her happy anymore, but i still wish her happiness.

I guess this is my way of cleaning my head. Nights have been very very bad since it all happened. I'm writing this as a way to calm them, to get the things that haunt me out.

She doesn’t know how to cook. Refuses to really learn. Complains about everything. But she loves me… Enough of that… i have about 70k in debt. Mainly because of my wife and her family’s influences. My emotions go crazy when something that involved social hierarchy negatively happens. I basically turn in to a blob of anxiety. I just wish I could see other people. I wanna have sex again. I feel like I’m passing people who I might actually be happy with. But i know if I cheated i’d be the bad person. But what do you expect. I’ve been really depressed lately. I’ve had to reject some people who i feel would make my life happier. I’ve been looking at my residence thinking how nice it would be to not remember anything. Be completely oblivious to everything. Just sit in a wheelchair all day long with a blank stare. I really wanna die. My life isn’t horrible. I just don’t appreciate it.,depression,2021-12-09 11:58:55

I stopped caring about my sports, my grades, etc. but because of covid last year, this is my first finals week and I feel like I’m starting to care. But not the healthy kind of care. Like the kind where if I fail, the Christmas lights won’t be the only thing hanging. But I also don’t care enough to actually study. So I feel as if I am hurdling towards an impending doom.

I told myself it’d just be until the pandemic died down. I thought I would be able to get back on track with my education soon enough… I ended up loving my job and the people i work with. in september a situation happened with my coworkers that made me feel like they didn’t value me. it got resolved and everything was okay for awhile. but in the past week i’ve just been sad. sad that all my friends from high school are getting to live out their dreams at university. i also feel like maybe the situation from september wasn’t as resolved as i thought? i feel like whenever something goes wrong, my coworkers automatically assume it was me. I feel like my coworkers secretly despise me but won’t say it to my face. it makes me very sad as i view these people as somewhat my friends. i’m not sure if i’m reading into situations too much and they aren’t really mad at me or if i’m catching onto real things that are happening. I feel like i’m looking into things too much, especially because these feelings are popping up at the same time as the feelings about university. im also scared that i’m going to be stuck at this job for the rest of my life. as much as i love my job, i cannot see myself doing it forever. so i guess if you have advice i’d appreciate it!! thanks for reading <3",depression,2021-12-09 08:03:31

I got bored and fed up with my hometown during covid. I decided to move somewhere for a fresh start. It has brought me quite a bit more stress and depression, which was the opposite of my plan. 

I've spent so much money. I know no one here. I have a drinking problem that I can't seem to shake. I can't help but feel this is the beginning of the end.

143,rc77oa,I’m a human wrecking ball,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rc77oa/im_a_human_wrecking_ball/,1,"I haven’t been this depressed in 3.5 years. The last time I was, I was about to leave a super abusive relationship. I was pushed over the edge and ended it, cut the person out of my life and started putting myself, goals and dreams first. It was like the world went from black and white, to color. Food tasted good again. I enjoyed things and seeing friends and family, the numbness of the relationship started melting away. 

Fast-forward and Covid hits. I move out of the town I’ve called home for the last few years, to a new city. I continue growing as a person and building a new network of friends, land an amazing job, become closer with my parents. I meet someone when I’m least expecting it, who is nothing like my abuser was, and makes me feel respected, loved, supported. After 9 months of cautiously falling in love, I move in with him, in the midst of a renovation, and while work is more stressful than ever. (And we’re living through a pandemic which has taken a considerable toll on my mental health and worry for loved ones and self)

The transition has been extremely difficult. I’m super type A and have trouble navigating a kitchen and living room full of power tools and boxes. At first I tried to be chipper about it, but quickly became resentful that the renovations weren’t done and became snappy and short with my partner. When I finally started asking how I could help move things along, the small tasks he gave me, I didn’t even have the energy to complete. I cry uncontrollably and feel this gaping pit of despair open inside me. I feel hopeless and numb again. Even though this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in and my partner is the complete opposite of my former abuser. I feel numb and sick at the same time. Today I said something hurtful and pointed, to get a reaction out of him. And he later confessed that it was the first time He’d questioned our relationship - that the fact I had purposefully hurt him had opened a crack in our foundation. 

I know this depression is in part fear of falling into a dangerous space again, and losing myself, plus the transition to living together and preferring things a certain way. I don’t want to feel like this any longer. Any tips and shared stories are appreciated. Super grateful this sub exists 💜",depression,2021-12-09 07:46:51

It was one thing to feel unhappy about the things that went wrong in my life, but most of what I suffer from now is entirely my own fault.

I've been out of work for four fucking years. How the hell does someone do that? It's complicated. I really can't say. I thought there was something at the end of it for me though. But it didn't work out. I could never turn my life around in a new place like I hoped. It was an impossible situation to begin with.

Now it's coming to an end. I can no longer sustain the way I was living and find myself going back to the same dark hopeless situation I was in before, but with far less of anything that I came in with. I don't have any money, no car, everything I used to use to cope is no longer available to me. I can never get a job like I had before, I'm four years older and the job opportunities available to me are all situations where I'll be humiliating myself in the town I hoped I could escape from.

I'm at a point where I no longer care about the things that made me depressed in the first place - bad childhood, toxic relationship, ruined friendships. I wish I could slide back in to the life I had a few years ago, even with all that depression, but I am completely and utterly fucked and find myself wanting to end myself rather than put myself though what is coming for me.

What all started due to loneliness and feelings seems to be leading to an outcome of pure economics. I failed to achieve adulthood and it's far, far to late to imagine that I can. I've fallen so far behind and am basically entering the 'irreversable decay phase' of my life and have nothing to show for what I've been though so far.

It's hard to imagine that I'd be looking back on the life I felt so bad about and thinking of that as the good old days - having no friends and making no friends and staying up late every night playing video games. And it will always hurt for as long as I have left, that the changes I made in my life that I thought would be for the better did not work out and I've just ended up in a deeper despair than I've ever been in before.

162,rcah9t,feeling empty and hopeless,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rcah9t/feeling_empty_and_hopeless/,1,"Hello this is my first time posting on Reddit I hope I do it properly!!! So some background is I'm a 24 year old female still living at home, I got a college degree but still work in fast food cause I struggle with bad anxiety that prevents me from tackling change. Covid hit right when I finished college so it prevented me from finding a job at first and now it's just myself holding me back. I hate my job and want to find a new one so much but the idea of interviews and being rejected makes me avoid it, and the degree I took in college isn't something I like if I'm being honest so I feel utterly lost and like I have no direction. I feel like a cog in a machine set to work for the rest of my life and I hate it. I just feel so lost and imagining myself in a 40 hour office job for the rest of my life makes me feel so much despair. I can't share this with many people because I know I would be called lazy and get told ""that's the way life is deal with it.""

When I go to work I'm able to act normal and I crack jokes a lot and try to make my coworkers smile because deep down I've realized I'm a people pleaser and I want people to like me. I want to feel needed and like I'm seen. Because otherwise I feel like I'm invisible and like I could disappear and no one would care or notice.

I struggle with self esteem with my appearance constantly. As someone who grew up ugly it really made me grow up with no confidence and it effects me to this day. I genuinely don't even know what I look like anymore. Some days I wake up and see my face and feel I look fine, and other days I look and feel disgusted. 

My coworkers think I'm a bubbly happy person and I wish that were the case but the second I go home after work I go to my room and play video games mostly alone and feel this void in my chest. I feel heavy and empty and hopeless. I feel lazy and worthless and like I've done nothing with my life. I feel like I'll never have anyone who loves me and never get to truly love anyone. Even my parents don't really love me and haven't since I was very young. I'm grateful they still let me live at home and pay cheaper rent but they constantly take digs at me and it wears me down and makes me feel more useless and behind on life then I already do. They think I'm very lazy and constantly compare me to my 28 year old brother who has a full time job and moved out when he was 24. 

I've never actually gotten help for my obvious mental health issues because as a teenager I went to my mom and she would tell me ""how could you have that when I grew up having a much harder life"" or when I went to her for my horrible insomnia she would say ""you think you have insomnia? I haven't slept in blank amount of time!! Try sleeping that little."" She would constantly say things to make me feel guilty and like I had no right to complain. 

My parents are VERY old fashioned and just don't believe mental illness could happen to anyone they know lmao. They also think taking pills for help mental illness is horrible. 

I barely have any friends anymore because after covid hit I drifted away from the 2 best friends I had. I have a few other friends but we barely talk and I have a hard time with reaching out to people without feeling like I'm being annoying or unwanted. I have online friends which I feel I can be more open with but even then sometimes it feels like I'm so disconnected and like they don't truly know me? I have a few new friends from work but a lot of them are leaving soon and I feel so behind which makes me feel like such a loser since I've been at my job so long. A lot of my coworkers when they're new think I'm around 18 and are so shocked to learn my age because of how I look and because of how I am I suppose. I don't feel like I should be 24 I feel like the world should have paused like we all had to when covid hit and the past almost 2 years have been honestly a blur.

I wish I could redo my life and try again but I can't and it makes me want to end everything. I just can't fathom the idea of living like this for much longer. I know I have to be the one to change. I have to be the one to search for help for my mental health now that I'm older. I know all that but it just seems so pointless I just feel like I should never have existed in the first place if life was gonna make me feel this way. I just wanna be normal and be able to feel happy again. I want energy back. I wanna feel passion for my hobbies again.

Honestly the only thing truly keeping me here is my dog. I got her when I finished school and she is the one thing on earth I can say actually loves me and makes me feel like I belong here. I feel like if I was gone she would be so lost and she would have such a hard time adjusting to a new owner. 

I just wanted to share with anyone how I truly feel deep inside cause I feel like I'm drowning and can't take much more.  I hope it didn't sound like a bunch of excuses cause I know I have to take the first steps towards helping myself but I don't know how. I feel so alone. I feel so unwanted on this earth. I feel like if I poofed out of existence in this moment no one would notice and even if they did not many people would care. I wanna change so badly but I'm so lost. Thank you if you read this far I know life has been a struggle for so many of us I hope everyone can live their best lives.",depression,2021-12-09 10:47:04

I probably won’t, but I really want to, or feel like I’m getting Into a position where I feel I *have* to. I have a nice drawing to show my friends, will get some money. I want to spend that on someone I care about and peace out.

Over the past handful of years I’ve lost all my blood relatives. My min died, my sister died, my dad Is alive but doesn’t speak to me. So, I find It hard to find life worth living. I’m very Introverted so I don’t think I can make It In this world In any way and I’m bad at genuinely enjoying talking to most people. I just can’t find the energy to consistently talk to more than a couple people. I always feel like a bother so I prefer other people coming to me first. I suck.

Lately I’ve been struggling with not crying like a baby over stuff. I am female, so besides depression perhaps It’s a cause of menstruation. I’m really sensitive and It gets tiring getting hurt/“offended” by such small things. But I can’t help It. It feels like all my “quirks” like this In life cannot be helped. If I don’t know something I’m automatically stupid. I always think I’m being judged. I wish I could be nice to myself but Is It not good to be aware of your flaws?

I used to not go outside basically at all unless I had to, but maybe 2 months ago at the least Ive started taking walks to the mailbox when possible. I still feel like trash a lot lol or my mood gets ruined somehow whenever I start to feel better some. I also had a cat but that caused me more stress because family would not allow her to be anywhere else besides In my tiny room. I also have many plushies that are Important to me and didn’t want cat fur to get on them. 

To find purpose In life I got attached to a small mmo maybe 4 years ago now. I felt like I had a lot of friends and people were easy to get to know because It Isn’t big. I would edit the wiki of this game; I try to be humble but In a literal sense the wiki was pretty bad before I stepped up and Is now 99% up to date after a lot of hard work on my end. I am an artist so I’ve also contributed using some of my talent there. 

Unfortunately, the past year I’ve been antisocial because of toxic people and generally hating myself. I feel like I’ve lost touch with everyone. It feels really bad. I’ve always felt so welcome. I don’t think I’m really fit anywhere. Hard to not think I wouldn’t be better off not alive where I can’t hurt anyone and no one can hurt me.",depression,2021-12-09 10:43:17

I was passionate about my art. Now Its like i'm this hollow fragile version of who I was.  
The start of my depression happened when my father decided to move and leave me behind during my early teen years. Then some years later(Think I was 21 at the time)  I became heavily depressed after becoming extremely stressed over my progress with making music (This was once my outlet in life , helped me manage). That same year I was at a peak in my life , Finally became confident in social situations employment  & dating (was a huge hurdle for myself)

These days(Now 27) im numb to the good feelings of listening to music. Lost a good paying job some years ago because my sense of concern started going to the way side. Gained Over 80 pounds , Stopped being physically attracted to who I was dating at the time for years. We Broke up. My 20s have been mostly a waste just stuck in a rut with many failed attempts of making myself better (Medication , Therapists , exercise , meditation). I still work out multiple times a week but it doesnt help my mental state. It Just gives me some faint hope that perhaps i can improve my physique.   


Dont know why im writing all this maybe because recently I tried to learn to draw , at first it was fun but last night that voice I heard when getting extremely stressed over music came back. ""Your work isnt good enough , what you did before was a fluke"" etc . Today im packing up all my art supplies and music equipment . Think im just done.... Maybe I just need to accept that I cant pay the toll of making my own work , the thought of that would just be a final nail. Being this deeply depressed for years makes me hate myself.... its just so pathetic",depression,2021-12-09 03:10:02

For context: I (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating long distance for almost 2 years now. He is majoring in computer science and has been dealing with anxiety since I first met him. Right now we’re in peak exam season and he’s under alot of stress. 

He very recently got diagnosed with depression, though we’ve both kinda knew he was struggling with something since entering post-secondary. Recently he seems to be putting himself down alot over his physical looks and over his abilities as a boyfriend. He has also had alot more angry outbursts over things I would consider smaller like me not doing work with him until a set time even if I’ve finished all the work I needed to complete. I’m not upset at him or anything because I understand that’s he’s going through something so to not take it to heart. 

I just wanna be supportive and be there for him but me, being an optimist, I don’t wanna say the wrong things or end up pushing toxic positivity.

I'm exhausted. I'm just completely emotionally drained.

Last year with the pandemic I hoped I would be able to fix my mental health. I took a sabbatical period off before going to college and well... It didn't fix shit. Now that I'm studying, I can barely endure it. Not because I'm lazy, I like my career just that... What's the point?

That's a question I've been having way too much lately. What's the fucking point of waking up? Going to class? Trying to have a good relationship with anyone?

I don't feel anything from any of that anymore. I don't feel happy, sad, angry... Nothing. It's just something that happens.

I don't feel accomplished by turning in assignments, I don't feel genuinely happy from speaking to friends (the few I have left anyway), i don't feel angry for being such a useless piece of shit who's only good for annoying those around him.

I don't even know anymore.

I've never been actually diagnosed with depression. I've never gone to a psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, nothing. And that's my main fear.

Maybe I'm overreacting. Normal people deal with the bullshit of adult life on a daily basis and they never complain or whine nearly as much as I do. Maybe I'm just a loser who still can't wrap his head around adult life. Maybe I'm just a man child who thinks life can be easy.

Maybe I'm the problem. Am I the problem?

...

Christmas is coming and I love Christmas. It's the only time of the year when I can at least think that I'm happy. Even if the lights get more and more dim, and the problems get bigger and bigger.

I always find myself crying infront of the tree every single year.

If I could just go back to when I was a kid, if my consciousness could've just stopped there... It would've been fine.

I just wanna go back to that. I just want to stop thinking and just, stare at the tree and get lost in the moment.

...

Im sorry to anyone who has to read this shit. I just want to vent up my emotions and feel like I'm not in one void space where nothing I say has any weight. I just want to feel like I exist.

But in my head the thoughts of all the ways I have screwed everything and everyone up just won't stop...Am I the only one?,depression,2021-12-09 00:36:31

I'm really scared of hospitalization, but I am so frustrated and angry and scared at my lack of progress with my treatment that I'll try anything if it'll work. Can anyone share their experiences with what they did when their medication wasn't making much of a difference and therapy was only offering minimal improvement?

This has been at home, when I've been in work, in my car driving to places, doing voluntary work on the local heritage railway near me, just anywhere and it would happen at any time of the day.

Due to the lockdowns, I had found myself thinking back a lot to how I've led my life so far and just getting incredibly depressed about being 28 and 

* still being single since I broke up with my last GF at the age of 13/14 
* never going on a date with anyone
* messing my knees up during trade training with the British Army resulting in a medical discharge for me back in 2014
* being stuck on near minimum wage jobs
* having to work overtime on a continuous basis for the past year to have a decent weekly income
* Getting fed up of doing the same thing at my old job with hardly any chance of progression
* being stuck living with my parents since 2014 for financial reasons
* Lacking friends and a social life
* Doing way too much voluntary work at my local air cadet group compared to the rest of the staff there

All of this kept hitting me and I have been beating myself up for it a lot. 

Today was the first day since September that I have been able to go without shedding a single tear or breaking down at all. I have been able to chat with a few friends about how I have been feeling for a very long time and have gotten a lot of support from them. Only thing I haven't done is seek professional help for it, simply because I don't want to be diagnosed as being depressed and I can't swallow pills (literally not metaphorically) so medication wouldn't be able to help me here.

Hopefully I can make it another day without crying again and hopefully I can beat back the bastard that is depression.",depression,2021-12-09 03:22:24

And I don’t even have anything to be depressed about which makes me feel like an even bigger piece of shit because I do have a good life that others would kill to have but I just feel like an ungrateful piece of shit because of it. 

I had a relationship with a girl earlier in the fall which had me feeling happiest I felt in a long time. But I was Muslim and she was Christian so it was already tough and she was also my first ever girlfriend. Surprisingly she made the first move too. We even lost both of our virginity to each other . But she later asked me whether I could come have dinner with her family about only a month into our relationship and me, smoking a joint as she asked me this no more than 15 minutes after we’ve just had sex and I go (I was high as hell) “we’re not even that serious.” Mind you it hasn’t even been 15 minutes and I’m butt ass naked in her bed.   Well she starts crying and tells me to leave which I do. The next day I basically apologize and and she starts telling me how I don’t share anything how I’m so closed off and I was never like this before we dated. 

But I was. She just didn’t meet the real me yet. I basically tell her that although I cared about her I had to let her go since I was just going to drag her down with me and infect her with the black hole in my life. We ended up hugging and she gave me a kiss saying she hoped I found help and she was always going to be there for me. A week later her friend calls me saying I’m a piece of shit and that she hasn’t left the house in a week and she’s a mess. I had thought we were done and I was trying to move on but hearing this just made me feel like an even bigger piece of shit than I already do. 

This isn’t really to anyone in particular but I thought I’d share my shit hoping someone maybe has the same kind of thoughts come into their head and how they coped with it. Like I said I just want to be happy again",depression,2021-12-09 09:00:22

Trying to find a career I want to spend the entirety of my life in. There's almost nothing I want to do, and the things I do like are dead ends with practically zero work opportunities.

My mother and I talked earlier today about school, life and work. I asked her what working was like, if it was hard. She answered that it was rough, but that she lived for the weekends. Suffering through the weeks just so that she could have dinners with friends when she was free. She said that no matter what I do, I will have to work. It is the constant of this universe.

I just can't do it anymore. I can't live like that. Waste away in an office, cry myself to sleep every damn day. High school sucked. University sucks. And guess what? Working will suck too. Life sucks.

I'm having a really hard time justifying staying alive. If all there is to life is endless slave labor and suffering, why not just die? Why do I have to ""stay strong"" and ""keep fighting""? For what? More work and pain?

Go ahead. Call me a lazy fucking snowflake or whatever you want. I'm fed up. I can't live like this and I hope I can muster up the courage to end this shit once and for all.",depression,2021-12-08 22:22:05

all i do all day is study because i don't have any hobbies or the motivation to pick up new or old ones (i just study, waste time online, go on walks), and still my grades are going to be mediocre to failing. i almost want to fail so i'll lose my financial aid and have to drop out-- at least if i move back home my parents will force me to get help and make my life better. i wanted to take time off but i got talked out of it. i love (or used to love) my field of study and i just wish i could produce good work about it, but i'm taking hours and hours to produce the most mediocre shit. i've never known exactly what i want to do and it's getting harder and harder to imagine a future. 

the only things that make me happy are drinking--which i stopped doing, because i know that's a risky road, and being sober (but not ""justified"" in it because i never had a problem) has just made me more distant from my friends who don't get it--and going to concerts (both of these are followed by crashes). i'm going to one tomorrow, even though i should be studying, so that's hopeful. i don't really have any more immediate coping strategies, like how to feel good enough this week to write my papers and how to stop myself from crying in class, so i would appreciate if anyone could help with that.",depression,2021-12-09 02:51:04

I have been struggling up and down for over 3 weeks now. And Sunday night I finally broke my own emotional dam. 

Most of the time a little bit just comes out over the top when I have been holding back too much, and other things can put holes in it, but this time I broke it myself.

I have been holding in some really big things. The person who cares the most about me said, “don’t close the door and shut me out”, and I finally let them in and dropped the heaviest thing of them all. 

I have been a mess for 3 days now. I cry on my commute to work and home. I hold it all together for work (8 hours), and I am exhausted afterwards. 

I made an emergency therapist appointment for today, and I need it. I will be a wreck after, I need this. I need to feel all of this and figure out how to work through it.

My support system doesn’t know how to help me or deal with this. I’ve felt extremely alone the past 3 weeks, and I have been reaching out to, well everyone, because I need help, I need someone to talk to distract and talk about the fun things.

I thought I had escaped my abusive ex-boss and ex-colleagues. I thought I had escaped it all, but it’s fucking happening again. 

Context: I just moved to the capital from the country in the UK. I moved because I got a job in investment banking after being fired by my abusive ex-boss because she was fucking insane. Where I’m working now has treble the salary, a free degree and they all think I’m great at what I do. It’s a much harder job than what I did for the witch. 

In a nutshell, I’m not just crying wolf that I’ve been abused by a lot of people. I know people might say it to “save face” when they get fired, but genuinely please believe me that this has happened. I was TERRIFIED of my ex-boss and she made it that way purposefully. 

Anyway, unfortunately where I’ve moved to has a carbon copy of my boss living here. I know it’s silly, but I could tell I wouldn’t like her instantly, just like my ex-boss. I don’t let this taint my interactions of course, but honestly I can instantly tell sometimes. 

I’m not doing to devalue PTSD, but I have some kind of mild PTSD (for lack of a better term) from my ex-boss about this kind of persons behaviour. You know what I mean anyway. NOTHING is ever good enough for them. You walk on eggshells just trying to do things in your daily life. She’s made me afraid to go to the bathroom or the kitchen. I’m afraid to go in and out so I’m confined to my room. 

I have Aspergers and I have very low confidence. Im the sort of person who is always checking whether other people would approve of my behaviour. I have never intentionally gone out of my way to disturb people, quite the opposite. Im just so sick of these entitled hen peckers. 

So, it’s my third day here. I’ve only met her once properly. She chastised me for “using her towel” (I put it back on the towel rail. I didn’t use it. Besides, where she keeps it it could be easily mistaken for a towel that the landlord has put for the whole household. No one else keeps it there.) 

Also, there’s a fault with the seal on the shower door. It won’t shut. I hold it while I shower so that no water gets out. She SCREAMED - she legit screamed because there was a tiny amount of water on the shower mat that is supposed to get wet. There was literally nothing wrong. Another girl went in there before her after me and didn’t say anything. She knocked on my door and berated me like I was her child and she hated that I wasn’t doing my usual behaviour: saying sorry repeatedly. 

I know it’s only been a couple days but I know it’s going to get worse. She is a clone of my ex-boss: middle-aged, short choppy pixie cut and sneering. Her personality is the same. I can only imagine what hell she will raise when I bring my bf over. 

Also to note: she has been talking on the phone REALLY LOUDLY quite late for about 2 hours. Am I fucking complaining? I’m working. But no, I’m a reasonable person who doesn’t enjoy the attention from being a little snitch. 

Do I have “abuse me and control me” written on my face??


P.S. I’m wondering if this is some sort of internalised misogyny thing or “queen bee” phenomenon. Most women who have been like this to me are middle-aged. I’m 21. I’m wondering if it’s a sort of establishing hierarchy bullshit, or if she feels threatened because I’m young (I don’t want her to be, you know what I mean anyway..)",depression,2021-12-09 03:32:17

I am ashamed. I hate myself even more. I am disgusted by who I have become. I am drinking almost a pint of vodka per day just to numb my emotions and pain of depression. Getting out of bed seems like a chore.

It has even led me to do things that are way out of character for me. I was so hungover for work one day that I couldnt go in, so I said that my stepfather passed away as an excuse for a few days off. It was completely on a whim and I couldnt even believe it after I did it. All because of alcohol. I am probably going to have to resign from the job as HR is now wanting to meet with me. I am disgusted by myself.

I had a great job as a nurse. I have a great family. A great gf of 8 months. I just keep self-sabotaging myself with alcohol. It just goes to show what a monster depression really is. As im about to be without a job, maybe I need to take this time to get myself together mentally. There are plenty of jobs for nurses out there, so I’m trying to stay positive. But I have now ruined my last 2 jobs and I’m financially ruined. I'll probably have to ask for some help from my dad in the meantime, which kills me.

I hope I am not alone. Im just looking for any kind of support and advice out there right now, and this community is going to be a big part of me getting through this.

I'm definitely not a terrible socialiser, just before covid hit I had times where my depression was at its lowest and I felt confident, and normal when it came to interaction, just about.

When my depression hits hard I just can't talk to people, nothing is funny anymore, I have no desire to talk, share interests, learn about others or care about what they have to say. I have a hard time verbalizing my thoughts inside my head and expressing things, it's a headache to try and dig through my mind to find common, regular words that I normally shouldn't have trouble with. Even having to write things like this typed, I often have to pause and reiterate things or rephrase things because I can't express it as I'd like to the first time.

Recently started a new job and having to be social and all that is just such a daunting task, I've recently been motivated to improve myself, take care of myself better, and try to get out of the hole again however everything is just SO difficult.

I don't know where to post this, thought this might be the place. Sorry if I doing something wrong here.

I have to say though, I think I'm in a better place than some people struggling but still......

A first year undergraduate student at a university in Tokyo. Came here as an international student, living alone. Not understanding the material that I'm learning demotivate me even more. I know that I'm already stupid, but the material that were taught here and all the bright students here makes it even worse for me. I can't really keep up with the stuff here, maybe I'm just straight up born stupid. I always felt I was struggling even with simple stuff since I was in primary school. Ending up spent most of my time studying during those days just to keep up.

One time, the professor told the class to explain the answer for a physics question, which I'm unable to, standing in front of the blackboard looking like an idiot and now most classmate ostracize me (at least that's what I'm thinking cause they seem don't want to talk to me), causing me to be more afraid to talk and make any friends, ending up with no friend.

Seeing my other friends at other places doing so well in their own universities makes me envy of them and wish I can be like them.  Visiting places, making new friends, doing cool and awesome activities. I can't really go to places or spending money on stuff I want just yet because Tokyo's living cost is high. I just feel miserable right now.

Even if I ranted on social media, people just keep telling me everything's going to be fine when in reality it's just get worse for me. I'm just tired.

Why I always struggle with things? It's just doesn't feel fair. Even if I try so hard, it just never went well for me.

I feel like I want to kill myself or do anything just to make me feel something.

And again, I'm sorry if I wrote this in a wrong place, I just want a place to let this out.",depression,2021-12-08 22:53:06

I'm a college student currently in their third year of school and I'm basically at this point scrapping the barrel in classes. When I started school in Sept, I thought I was going to be able to move forward, since I'm now 20 and not a depressed teenager... right?

Well, I feel so empty right now. My diet has shifted to eating frozen Eggo waffles and ordering Wendy's from Grubhub almost every night. I've confined myself to my room and I can barely leave the apartment to go to work. I'm behind in all of my classes and it's currently the week before finals and I'm realizing I might fail this semester, which I'm afraid might cause me to lose my Pell Grant. I don't even know how to start fixing this mess and the thought paralyzes me to the point that I spend most of my time just staring at a screen watching the same five videos to feel... something. I often stay awake through the night and use energy drinks to stay awake on the days I need to work (I work a breakfast shift, so 6 to 2) and then on class days, I don't go. I go to sleep and miss the entire day until 3. It also sucks that I live in a northern place where it gets dark at literally 4 o'clock in winter, which makes me feel even darker. I've missed classes since probably late October. I don't remember the last time I set foot on campus. I don't know what I'm going to do. I had a breakdown at work a few days ago and even then, I'm just stuck. I feel like I need to quit my job, but I don't know how to tell my boss and then he gave me a Christmas bonus which makes me feel guilty for wanting to quit. My best friend is having a really hard time trying to help me and I feel so bad for putting him through all my bullshit. I don't know how to explain to my parents why I'm failing classes. They know about my depression but I feel so ashamed that I've let myself go and classes go that I can't bring myself to explain to them why this semester went so wrong. This is even more compounded by the fact that two years ago, I left school because of a depression episode like this once, and then Covid happened and I took a year off school. And this year, I thought, hey, I want to go back to school. I'm older, I'm more confidant, I can do it! And now I feel so dead inside that I don't even remember that summer version of me. I think my roommate hates me because he's basically living with a ghost who doesn't seem to exist except to leave his room in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I even went to the doctor to try to explain all this, as well as the fact that I developed some breathing issues like a dry throat and hiccups, though how severe they are is kind of hard to tell. They did some lab results and they could only say that my red blood count was low, which sort of makes sense. I haven't been taking my meds (Zoloft, previously 100mg, up to 150mg since 2 weeks ago) regularly or even frequently, even though I feel like they are more of a placebo effect since I didn't feel like I feel THAT great on them to matter. I just feel so doomed. I had this dread creep up on me in September like, ""Watch out... it's coming..."" and now I feel like it's over for me. I don't really want to die and any suicidal ideation I've had is quite mild. I've never attempted and the closest is just thinking, I want to die. But I don't actually. It's like the one source of hope I have is that I actually want to be happy. I haven't lost the want to live a happy life. I just don't want to live LIKE THIS. And I don't know how to get out of it.

I’ve had intense anxiety for as long as can remember, but lately it has seemed to crawl into every part of my existence. I haven’t gone a day in the last year without suicidal ideations. 

The thought of getting out of bed in the morning is absolutely nerve wracking. I can barely make eye contact when I pass my roommate in the kitchen. I’ve completely forgotten how to hold a conversation. I used to love to joke and laugh with people, but lately, the only thing that comes into my mind are automatic negative thoughts. “You’re a fucking piece of shit” on loop in my brain. 

I have a loving, gorgeous, engaging partner that I feel myself growing more distant from. They live 1.25 hours from me so I was able to hide my mental illness, but now I can’t put on a “happy face” during the precious time we get to spend together each week. I feel absolutely worthless as a person and a partner. 

I work from home 9-5 and haven’t the slightest bit a motivation to complete a single item on my to-do list. I’ve been falling behind and I just started. I just simply can’t bring myself to get out of bed. 

A win for me is getting up to take a shower. I just lay on the floor of the bathtub for an hour until my roommate bangs on the door. Then I go back into bed and lay there for hours. When I get out of “work” I just lay in my bed and dick around on youtube. I’m barely eating and in the last month I’ve lost almost 10 pounds. When I look in the mirror it doesn’t even feel like there’s a person looking back at me. Just an empty shell. 

I have so many people I could call that I know love me, but honestly they would be better off I was gone. Most of them don’t know the extent of my mental illnesses. I live in fear and shame.

When I can muster the strength, I write in my journal that I want to live. But I’m growing more and more aware that death would mean the end of all my suffering and that’s when thoughts of suicide roar the loudest in my head.

First things first I have been severely depressed since I was about 13 years old. I’m now 22, have a 2 year old son and a lovely wife that I feel I take for granted everyday. After my suicide attempt a few years back I decided I wanted to get out of my rut so I went through therapy, got counseling, took medicine, tried finding hobbies, distractions, I’ve done basically anything you can think of to try and relieve how I feel and absolutely nothing works, having my son and moving in together as a family this young has definitely made things harder. I’m stressed about work as I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life, I’ve been job hopping since I was barely 18 because I don’t want to be miserable to make a paycheck, I have health issues, injuries etc. 

I’m stuck in the shittiest place I’ve ever been in because now I’m a husband and a father to a little boy who needs me to be the dad that I didn’t have growing up and it’s so fucking hard. I have no financial future/stability as of now, i’m in a void of sadness that I just for some reason can’t pull myself out of, i’m a complete mess and constant failure/disappointment to a woman and a child who deserve someone who can give them so much more in life. Also there’s so much shit that needs to be paid for every month it’s so goddamn overwhelming when the majority of the time I end up unemployed for various reasons. I don’t have a career, I don’t have any skills, I literally suck at basically everything I try and working in places that are absolute dog shit like I have been makes me even more depressed. 

I know everyone says “you have to get over it and do what you have to so you can provide for your family” but it’s SO fucking hard because I have resentment towards being alive in general and having to put all this effort into my life that I have to pretend to actually care about is mentally depleting me. Now about my wife.. I love her with all my heart.. but lately it’s gotten so hard to be there for her the way she needs, to just do things for her, be romantic, just be a loving husband. I feel like I have no energy left to do anything for or with her, I’m constantly tired or sad to the point I want to stay cooped up in the house but she is ALWAYS going to see her family or going out to do something and I never want to go. I never want to be around her family because I feel like a disappointment to them and I’m uncomfortable around them considering they all talk shit about me behind my back(heard this multiple times now from both of her brothers). 

I just feel like i’m not enough for her anymore.. the other day I called her beautiful and she told me “thank you I haven’t heard you say that in months” and I’ve been so stuck in my head I had no idea. I try to just be here for her, just love her the way I know and that to me is completely different than how everyone else thinks love is meant to be shown whether it be social media or whatever. I feel like i’m losing my touch with her, I feel like i’m a bad father, I’m hurting more than I ever have before and when I try to talk to people it’s always me saying the exact same things and after a while what are they even supposed to say to someone like me?? There’s only so much they can say you know? 

I have people that love and care about me but I feel more alone than ever before, I want to be someone, I want to make my family proud, I want to make myself proud, I want to be happy with who I am and the things that I do, I want more out of life, I’m drained of all potential drive that I could possibly have because it’s like there’s a spot in my brain that is supposed to be working that just ISN’T, that’s exactly what I’ve felt like for years now and it’s slowly breaking me down and killing me inside. I have no social life, I have honestly lost my enjoyment for just about every single thing in this shitty ass world, I don’t know how to be happy anymore, I have spurts of entertainment and slight joy that quickly goes away. 

Everyone always says to people it’s on YOU to change things but I fucking can’t. I’ve tried and i’ve tried. How do you change things when there is no will to? When you’re so drained and drug down that you barely have the desire to live? That’s what people don’t understand about depression, I WANT to change, I want happiness, I want a better life, but I’m fucking TIRED. I’m beaten and i’m lost and already so far down that I just feel like I’m going to be here forever. 

TLDR; Depression is taking away my value towards life and my family, happiness in general and I’m clueless on what to do at this point.",depression,2021-12-09 01:33:09

I've been on and off meds for about 7 years now, somehow I started smoking pot and replaced it with the meds. Eventually after 2 years of smoking daily I'm drained, I went back to my psychiatrist and he prescribed Prozac, Cymbalta(Duloxetine) and Bupropion. I started the treatment this week but at the end of each day I do smoke a joint. Apparently after smoking so much I can't just stop. I'm having panic attacks, high anxiety and blurred vision. I'm not sure if it's from the treatment or from the interaction between the treatment and cannabis.
Does anyone else take antidepressants while smoking pot? I'm not ok..

It's been more than 2 years since my life has become  a bottomless pit.

Beside I find life to be boring as hell, I have no passion anymore, I don't want anything anymore. I just do what is necessary. Even eating, I keep it to the most simple way : no cooking only cans. Don't need to warm it, it's ready to eat.  I still do some sport because it helps to use the spare time between work and sleep. Otherwise I should be crying alone, in the middle of lightless flat.

I don't understand why I am now like that. It is still painful sometimes but I always think that after all, my life could be worse. But I can't talk of everything to my friends ofmr family. I don't want them to be concerned. They have their problems already and I don't want to be another problem on their list.

I don't think I'll find someone anymore. I don't talk much. I don't go out. I afraid to talk to strangers. And I have a very bad self-esteem.

But I accept it. I cannot change anything so let it be. I know that solitude and emptiness will kill me. But I can't do anything. It is too late.

I am just a ghost. Alive or dead don't change anything. The world hasn't changed when I came, and it will not when I'll be leaving. I doubt many people'll notice that I'm gone. .

When I was 5 I knew something was different about me. Didn’t really know what that was, but I always said “I want to be a girl” since I was born a “boy”. 

And when I was 19 I got my wish, so to speak. I was in my freshman year of university and I was absolutely miserable, in fact I really wanted to die. So, I dropped out via medical leave for depression and came back home to my moms. All I could feel and do was nothing. I just wanted life to be over. I went on Reddit and found a sub called asktransgender and someone helped me get in contact with this trans clinic near me. So I made an appointment and I went. I was absolutely terrified. The thought that people, including the doctor, knew I was looking to get hormones terrified me for some reason. I got my hormones by informed consent and honestly that first week was so magical. Felt like I was on some muscle relaxant drugs or something. 

Fast forward to me almost turning 25 this month and while the hormones are great I really, really need more. I need full body laser hair removal, genital reconstruction surgery, and possibly facial feminization surgery. But honestly I feel like I’ll never get this stuff. Insurance doesn’t cover anything. I heard grs and ffs CAN be covered, but you have to jump through so many hoops and that’s something I really don’t have energy for. I can’t even clean my room. Trying to clean it today cause I’m feeling like I have to turn a new leaf, but I just feel like my problems aren’t fixable.

Back to my childhood, I grew up in a really toxic home and I think that’s one of the reasons I’m fucked up. Not really sure when it started, but maybe since 2nd grade? I know it got really bad when I was in 3rd-5th grade. My parents would always yell at each other and I’d go to sleep with my ears ringing or them screaming. My dad was an abusive alcoholic from what I could gather from my memories. I remember one day I was doing my homework with my cat and he comes behind me and asks what I’m doing, I reply “I’m just doing my homework with my cat” and he slaps me and tells me to do my homework and leaves. I stopped doing my homework after that and I went to my room to cry. Ugh, the irony..

I was also badly bullied. I remember grades 3-5 being extra awful. I don’t really know why I was the one they loved to pick on. Maybe because I was the white kid? Was I ugly? Was I dumb? I don’t really understand, but I do know what they’ve done hurts me still to this day. Maybe I wasn’t cool. Maybe I was a jerk. I don’t know. But it’s shaped me my whole life. I remember in 5th grade I told them I wasn’t going to be there with them in 6th grade since I was moving school and they all cheered. I’ve always felt so worthless. I always shut up and never really spoke much. As of today I don’t think my social skills are any good. I was hanging out with a friend yesterday, we were getting high and I just kinda sat there. Just nodding off from the weed. Yeah I know I was high, but I don’t think I’m good at talking. Or maybe I’m too hard on myself idk.

So with the home and school issues I just escaped my whole life. I would go to school and come back home and binge eat, play video games, cry, and sleep. I became suicidal by the time I was 9 or something around there. 8-10yo was when it started getting real bad. 5th grade was awful. They would call me fag(got), bitch, dumb, gay, etc. I started cutting my wrists. I even scratched myself in class. I remember I would befriend this kid Angel and we would just talk about music and share what bands we listen to. It was really cool. We listened to stuff like atreyu, mcr, Silverstein, Hawthorne heights, mudvayne, etc. But then we got grouped up for some games and he was with me along with like 3 other kids and they started making fun of me and he joined them. I said I thought we were friends and he said he didn’t want to be made fun of either. I understood that. But I still felt bad. I felt really bad and so we were no longer friends.

And the teachers always thought I was a “trouble maker”. I remember in 3rd grade this girl would cut herself and tell the teacher that it was me. Obviously it wasn’t me, but it didn’t matter. I was punished and sent to detention. 

I never felt like anyone ever had my back. And I never felt like life was good. The only time life was good was when I escaped into video games. And honestly that’s sad. My parents would always make remarks like “why are you not outgoing” or something along those lines. I could never tell them the actual reason or they’d get mad. Like what you want me to tell you the reason I’m not outgoing is because you’re a shitty ass parent that fights with the person you got married with? That all that time you guys spent fighting was time not spent on your kids? That I’m getting bullied in school? Would you even care? Because you certainly don’t care about your kid getting slapped in the face by my dad and you two yelling all the fucking time.

Even today... I tried to tell my mom stuff like how my brother, my cousin, etc put his penis inside me once. She didn’t care. Said I’m lying. I told her how I’m a woman, her daughter, and that I want to be respected as such. She doesn’t fucking care and still calls me her son and it drives me crazy. I became homeless because she said wouldn’t want me in the house if I’m a woman - so I left for a year. I came back and she would get upset if I tried to make her feel bad for making me homeless because according to her I left by myself I wasn’t “kicked out”. Like cmon man I can never fucking talk to you about anything I can’t even fucking joke with you. Interactions between her and I is just awkward.

I feel so dead inside. I feel like I’ve been dead since I was 9. Everyday I tell myself my biggest regret was not killing myself when I was young. Life hasn’t been great after 5th grade.

Bullied, but still better than before - 6th grade

Not really bullied, but not really acknowledged either - 7-8th grade

Just a loner who gets along with everyone, but doesn’t really feel like I have any friends out of school and still play on my computer all day to escape my life - HS

A loner trying and failing to make friends and getting suicidal again - college

A loner who fell in love with her bf, but in the end he left her because she’s too clingy, depressed, and stupid. And she’s sick all the time and now IBS-C has taken over her life and has roids/fissures so I can’t have anal. And no vagina cause I’m a stupid, broke, diseased tranny  - post college

Yeah that’s basically my life.

I was planning on cleaning my room today. Like every other day I said that. But what’s the point? It gets clean and then it’s going to get messy again because the problem isn’t the floor the problem is me. I’m never going to have the childhood I wanted. Hell I’m not ever going to have a good childhood. And it will never be a girls childhood. I blame my parents for having kids when they clearly weren’t ready for kids. I was always the trophy and not the kid. Always felt like I existed to make my mom feel better and not because she actually wanted kids. She never really put any effort in me. Sure we’d go to the park and I’d play there, but cmon that’s so basic. Why didn’t you teach me how to take care of myself? Skincare? Haircare? Teach me art? Teach me guitar? Anything! Why did you let me eat so much fucking food? I was fat as fuck. Why did you let me eat so much fucking candy and chips? I don’t feel like she really cared about me. Looking back if I was the mother I would make sure my child eats a healthy meal every day, I’d schedule my child’s day with art, music, science, and invite friends over so my child can socialize and play with others. I’d make sure my child brushed and flossed their teeth every day and if my child EVER gets a cavity at the dentist then it means I MESSED UP and I will not blame my child in the future “yeah well it’s your fault why didn’t you brush your teeth?!” Ugh. I literally told my mom my cavities are from the lack of her presence as my parent. I had this tooth that needed a root canal. The same tooth that had a crown since I was like, what, 7 years old or something? I’m in my fucking 20s and you can see how these things catch up. 

Every day I wish I had better parents. She’s fucking talking right now in the other room and it’s just fucking triggering me. Her voice, the music she listens to, everything just fucking triggers me. I hate being in this house with her. But I don’t have a choice as I can’t work. And rent is wayyyyyy too expensive.

I don’t understand why people have kids, but don’t want to be parents. It’s like I was a pet. 

I can’t ever release the pain I have. Because she will not accept any responsibility on her part. And if she does it’s always some half-ass apology. 

Man I’m almost 25 by the end of this month. I feel like those 25 years just flew away. And now I’ve already lived 1/3 of my life, that should of been the best years of my life, and now I’m supposed to live the other 2/3rds? I can’t even get up off my bed half the time. I need surgery, but no one wants to give it to me. I need therapy sure but after I had surgery. I can’t get better if I don’t get surgery. I need a fucking vagina. My dysphoria is killing me. And no one wants to believe me. It’s literally, physically killing me. I always have trouble looking at little girls in movies or real life. I get so jealous of their beautiful hair and their girl childhood. I’ve always wanted to have some girl friends over like a slumber party, do our makeup, and stuff like that. I’ve always wanted someone to hangout a lot with.

Idk..

Idk what to write anymore. Or do. I just want to die.

Feels like the only thing left for me to do is to decide whether I want to die with a bang or die fading away. Do I make some music bangers and then die? Or do I just die by hanging myself? How could I even top what’s already out there though? Juice WRLD did what I wanted to do. If I wanted to do that I’d just be a copy cat. Or is that where invention comes in? Since nothings original? Idk. 27 club looking real good ngl. That’s actually a song he has too though. What a great fucking song. Everything I write is either shitty, or too dark, or just copying what juice said/did. How can I be original when someone else has gone thru some of the things I had and wrote it before me? Idk.

I am 29 years old, I am fully dependant on my parents, I had a few jobs I failed at because it felt like dying everytime I had to put on an effort in it. I am unable to study, I lack de mental fortitute to it. Everytime I attempted studying, it felt like nothing was happening. Learning new things is something I've completely blocked, even though it's proved I don't have any cognitive disorder of any kind, I've been tested expensively. I have an average IQ, so I know I'm not specially dumb or nothing. I have no dreams, only fantasies. I lie a lot to maintain an appearance of a sort of a person with pride, goals, knowledge (that's my go-to bullshit, knowledge. I memorize somebody else's opinion about some trendy subject and vomit it at parties in order to bring some kind of value to myself or whatever attention my ego is arbitrarily demanding at the moment. Not having a career or any type of investiture in anything consequential brings me to do this kind of thing).

I have no real fundamental values, except the ones tangent to myself and my ego. I behave as if not to damn myself from the opinion of others that can be of some use to me. Like, I try to humour my dad. Little because of a real connection that there's with him, and more because he sustains me. Same with friends, or girlfriends. I just say shit to keep the relationship going. Otherwise, I feel lonely and horny. I lack empathy, respect, tenure. It's like I'm just a big mouth and a penis and an asshole. No soul behind it, no real investment in anything. Sometimes, I feel like American Psychopath's character Patrick Bateman, or the guy from Notes From the Underground, the asshole protagonist.

I've been like that for about 13 years. Now, I'm a consolidated man-child. And I don't even feel shame for it, although if you told 16 years me about it, he would rage against it. The rage is gone. Well, the good part of it, at least, the fire of life, that meaningful edgeness. I don't feel shame, but I have to keep appearances up in order to try meeting girls, or to keep a dignified face at dinner with people. I mean, being a man-child is not something someone would wear it in his face. I'm constantly aware of it, self conscious to the gills. Even paranoid. 

I've had a normal childhood. My brother is an overachiever, my mother was a ball buster (nice, loving woman, but everyone has defects), I moved from city to city growing up because of my father's work, so there are plenty of readily psychologycal reasons for small trauma. I've worked them out many times in therapy, many times. It was like nothing. Words in the wind.

It's kinda of astonishing for some people around me to find out the extent of the amount of nothingness I relate to and work on. My last girlfriend, for instance, is a hard worker, ambitious, young woman. She sees me like this and just goes ""How can you still live like a teenager?"" Well, it's just that I don't know how to do anything else. And it's a shame, really, because I'm a curious person, I read a lot about people (not that it brings me closer to humanity in any way shape or form), and it's fascinating how invested some of them are in learning, relating, being in a story of their and someone else's life. I don't relay. 

I'm not sure why I'm writing this here. I guess it's a realization I've had for a long while. It's odd. I felt odd for a long time. Knowing that you're parasitical and empty it's quite something.

I'm sorry, dad.

Well, thanks for reading.",depression,2021-12-08 19:48:41

Thank you for saving my life, I thank you for life. a very short story about me, I suffered depression for 9 years from age 13 to 21 and I will describe it in simple word 'demonic' why demonic because no words can describe how hard depression is, specially when you have no idea that you are suffering from depression and you just thought that it is only just your lifestyle, what I mean is you will not believe at first on yourself that you had a mental disorder and you continue fighting your own self that everything is normal and it is only just your lifestyle that make feel like that, and to make this a little short I go to a doctor to be specific psychiatrist and ask for help we had a talk and later she prescribe me antidepressant. My heart bleed seeing people suffer from depression because I know their pain, right now I don't feel sad anymore I don't feel worthless, I don't feel blaming myself anymore, I am not overthinking for 5 hours 10 hours 12 hours, I am not crying everynight thinking that I am useless, I don't feel any of that right now, I am now living normally free from depression, I feel happy, great and an awesome person, I am now happy and living normally ❤️.

Why do i have to go through all of this? Why do i have to live a life that I didn’t choose? Why did i have to give up on my hopes and dreams, sacrifice everything? Why did i have to pursue what someone else thought was good enough for me?
Life isn’t a life anymore. I’m just surviving. My days are just going by, determined by someone else. There’s no drive to achieve something, to accomplish something. It’s just pulling through the day somehow. And then fade into nothingness. A new day starts with a question, i.e. why? Why did i have to wake up? Why go through that crap again? There’s nothing to look forward to, nothing significant, nothing meaningful. 

Why motivate yourself to get out of it? What’s in store? Why even? It seems so easy to just give up and end it all. Anyway I don’t really do much for myself. It seems so much of a struggle. Not like someone is there to care for it. People may talk stuff about self love and all, and might use it to blame us. I guess they haven’t lived a life where they have never been accepted, been made safe, made felt loved, have had a home, after a very long time, but for a very short while. Or maybe they’re really headstrong. For them we are worthless imbeciles. Maybe so, and in that case I’m fine being that. I’m fine being made to feel guilty for not trying. No one gets it, how hard it is to try, how exhausting and draining it is.

It really hurts, you know, not to have a person who cares just for you, who is concerned about you, stuff like why you’re not taking care of your hair, teeny tiny stuff which your logical side plays down mercilessly. It hurts, when you know you have no one to run to, when you have had a shitty day. It hurts when you know there’s no one to hold your hands tight, to make you melt into a warm embrace when you have had a hard time. And this absence is something i have dealt with for almost the whole length of my existence. It hurts when you don’t have a safe home, where you can be weak, where you don’t have to be strong, practical, logical and mature. And you won’t have to feel guilty for feeling all of that.

It’s not like you have tried. You have tried, you have kept up your spirits after setbacks, but just to get pummelled down again. So much so that you break down, as it’s just you fighting pointlessly. You are trying to gain something meaningful and happy from something that someone else deemed as happy and fulfilling. Here you are, at a level more than decent as per the damned society, but it does not provide you the slightest amount of happiness. Your bank balance might be a source of practical comfort, but that’s as good as it gets. And it’s not enough. At the end of the day, you go to bed feeling unloved, uncared for, numb, tired, worthless,  under-confident and undermined. And worse, you feel guilty for feeling all that. You are supposed to feel grateful, for whatever you have. It’s like an imposition.

Why try? To keep this life that you didn’t even want? To forget all of this shit, shit which happened to you even after you didn’t do anything wrong? After all of these sacrifices? All of these disheartening dips, not spaced with good times? Should you force yourself to be happy, just because people might die to have what you have? And what about you? Are you happy?

And my last extrem down was about a year ago. I was admitted to a psych ward for nearly a month. There they diagnosed me again with depression among other things and including Borderline. I'm better for the most part. I'm taking my meds and talking to my therapist regularly. I even managed to finally get a job and I am planning on moving out. 

I don't know what happened today. Usually I'm a calm person and my emotions feel pretty dull most times. But an hour ago I just completely lost it over a broken alarm clock. I started screaming and crying and had this huge urge to hurt myself. I felt like I couldn't breathe properly. I haven't been able to calm down since then. I am just so furious and frustrated and I feel this huge amout of stess and anxiety. I can't seem to get my heartrate to slow down or stop shaking. 

I tried guided meditation like my therapist recommended but it just made me more furious to the point where I started throwing things. It's night time where I live so I can't reach my therapist and I don't feel like adding the anxiety of making a phone call would help me right now so I don't feel like I can call a support line. Even if I called I don't feel safe doing it with my mother in the same apartment. Talking to her is not an option because she is a huge stressor for me. I forgot my emergency meds at my dads since I haven't used them in over 6 months.

I feel like the past few months have been the most difficult in my whole life. I was born in Greece and moved to England with my family when I was 13, I am now nearly 22 and just work full time doing a job that I know I don’t want to do for the rest of my life. My dream has always been to travel and I’ve been saving up to do that. Covid slowed my plans down but I didn’t mind too much as my plan was to go in September or a bit later. I have now found out I’m pregnant and I have been so stressed out because I can’t make a decision on what to do as I keep changing my mind. On top of that I got a written warning at work for having time off even though I had doctors notes of all my absences in the past. On Saturday I also found out my grandma passed away. I am devastated she was and will always be my favourite person in the world, she raised me I spent so much of my childhood with her and I couldn’t even go to the funeral but at least I got to see her two weeks ago as I went to visit her in hospital but she couldn’t speak. She doesn’t live in England which is why I couldn’t be with her. I just feel like so much has been happening one thing after the other and I’m breaking down I don’t know what to do. 
Going back to the baby there’s a part of me that wants it and a part of me doesn’t. The main reason is the travelling. I don’t know if I’m ready to have responsibilities and commitments and not go travelling like I’ve always wanted to, but another part of me thinks that this happened for a reason and I really want to keep my baby. What I’m scared of is ending up living hefe forever and not be happy. My dream wa aka ways to live by the beach in a hotter country.

Last weekend the Woman I love got into a big argument with her Sister, who she was also renting a house with. Despite the fact her sister was the one not paying bills, its my Partner who has had to move out and can no longer live there for fear of her physical and mental safety. She was already dealing with a lot mentally and had already told me about suicidal thoughts the week before, so this is an a big tipping/breaking point for her. She's now homeless, lost her Sister (they we're very close to each other and almost inseparable) and doesn't want to live in the UK anymore but has no means to move. To make maters worse she also works with her sister, but hasn't been into work since. I've tried to be there the best I can for her, booking her a hotel for a couple of days, taking her to her Friends house (which just so happens to be her ex boyfriend so that's an emotional rollercoaster in itself for me) and trying to help her find places to live. Fortunately we have a holiday this weekend and I hope we can get away and try and clear her head to figure out her next move. The biggest problem I'm having is when I'm with her I'm very Emotional about all this, because I hate to see her so lost and low and feeling that she wants to take her life. Whereas she's emotionally numb, distant and cold, which can turn to her being snappy or annoyed when I get emotional, I want to be there for her and help best I can, and I am double checking that she does want me with her and she doesn't need space, and giving her space when she does want it, but its hard and really taking a toll on me mentally knowing that she is in an almost impossible situation that's hard to resolve. Does anyone have advice on how to be help and be comforting to someone going through something like this, and best way to be stronger for her when she is feeling emotionally void, doesn't want to be hold and doesn't want me to get emotional? I'm really looking for advice so when we go on Holiday I can make sure I help rather than hinder. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this :)",depression,2021-12-08 18:03:17

I just haven't felt great lately. A lot of shit has happened and im mostly just tired of living the same situation everyday. I have been staying at a lodge for the past couple of days, i'm not sure how long it's been, maybe a week. I thought I could gain some momentum in my life, possibly move to a place in this specific area, but this is all proving to be next to impossible. I technically don't have a job, I can't rent, so there's nothing I can do in that regard. I'm not going to go into the specifics as to why I don't have a job, I don't really have to. I do have money, but it's really not going to make a difference to the outcome. I feel completely alienated from society, simply a mere spectator. I see the fakeness, I see the greed. To me it's all an act, all a show and I'm sick and tired of it. Something that keeps happening to me is that, I'll go to a grocery store, for example.. and I wanna say, 7/10 times I'll be either accused or suspected of stealing. Now, I'm not sure the exact reasoning for this, but I have severe anxiety, and I'll tend to look around a lot, sometimes I'll change my mind as to what I want to get. For instance, I went to the store with the intention of purchasing water, but instead, I opted for milk. I was asked what I was looking for in both these occasions, and I answered honestly. I never even asked for assistance, because I want to take my time and not be rushed. I can just tell, however, just by the way they're talking to me, they have convinced themselves that I'm attempting to steal. The way I see it is plain rudeness, people are rude to me, apathetic and I can sense it depending on where I go. So I ask myself, why do I give people the opportunity to treat me like this? The other thing that happened, is, the seat of my e-Bike got stolen. Now who in the world would steal a damn e-Bike seat? It was a pretty nice seat, but you've honestly got to be some lowlife to do that. A couple of days ago I dropped my phone, which was already, absolutely ruined. It never turned back on, so I ended up getting lost in the city, resulting in me running into one of the scummiest people on earth. This individual (female) asked me for money, a shit load of money, but then assumed I wanted my D sucked for $100. (Which did NOT happen) They were aggressive and tried groping me. I'm not sure if that's the correct term but it was pretty traumatic and a form of sexual abuse to me. I'm just tired of being nice to people.. and whilst we're on this topic, I'm sick of being begged for money. I've done nice things in the past, but people don't even see those acts of kindness. They just want to label me without even knowing me. They're all out to get me. Every single one of them. They don't want to see me win in life. People just like to kick you when you're down but never help you up. I don't get this life. I don't see a way out of this. The past day or two, I have been mostly been in this bed. I haven't been eating at all and have had no energy at all to even get up. I don't know what to do from here and I don't know what to do with my life. It's everything. The confusion, the loneliness, the overwhelming anxiety, constantly sick and run down. I have bad thoughts sometimes, but it can't get much worse than what it's been.

One of my biggest life ambitions is to get married and have a family. In fact, it is my biggest objective. I'm a 25-year-old man and have a great career. Financially, I did everything right and I'm in a great position and where I wanted to be.

I haven't had a serious relationship in years. In fact, it might as well have been a different life. Disappointing fling after disappointing fling, I've realized that a relationship right now isn't on the cards and that it is best to carry on alone. In fact, I think I'm better off on my own despite that being contrary to what I ultimately want and desire.

I miss physical, intimate touch. I miss intimate relationships. I miss deep companionship. However, it simply isn't on the cards and that is just the reality.

When I look forward in life, I'm having to adjust my long-term goals. About where I see myself in 10 years, 20 years, etc. What kind of house I buy, what kind of lifestyle I envision, etc. It's very different after coming to this realization.

I take vyvanse and sertraline. I am feeling much better now than i was 5 months ago before i started sertraline. But I am still not right. I don't feel sad and negative anymore as my average/standard mood use to be, i feel pretty neutral but also kinda numb. I do also feel more sensitive downstairs which has been great and I am finding I am enjoying life and everything a lot more. The dark nights and miserable  weather of winter hit me hard and made me depressed for a while but I'm coming round to it now. 

Starting from my last year of uni in the school year 2018/2019 I started ordering codeine linctus online, to make what they call lean or purple drank. I'd use it for like a week or so every couple of months, i just liked how it made me feel. Imo it was more subtle than weed and nicer than alcohol too as i felt great but was still able to function as normal. It makes me feel warm and good inside. I occasionally had it for fun but mostly had it when i was in pain or was ill as its a good pick me up. Now i stopped this about 1¼ year ago, mainly because you could no longer get it online or over the counter in most places. About half a year ago my gf got a crap load of codeine as co-codamol prescribed for her back. She gave quite a lot to me over the months. I went away 2 weekends ago and the week running upto it I had the shits so i got prescribed codeine by my doctor, as nothing else works for me genuinely, not buscopan or immodium or anything. I got 56x15mg tablets. I finished the last of it today, 75mg. 

The thing is, i feel much happier when i take it, i feel more in the moment and relaxed. I'm so anxious all the time and don't know my own mind, most of the time i can't tell how i feel about stuff and it's horrible and kinda makes me want to die because i feel like I'm going insane. When i take codeine it makes me relaxed and know who I am and how i feel and don't constantly question and second guess myself.

Obviously I know this is bad in the long term, and I don't want to become addicted but idek what to do idk what's wrong with me",depression,2021-12-08 21:03:51

A couple years back when I was in 9th grade, my school was holding auditions for a play. Wanting to be really involved in the theatre program, I signed up. Fast forward to auditions. There were 18 kids there, including me, who were auditioning for an acting role. I did the best I could at auditions, just like everyone else. For extra important information, the play had a cast of 17, and as I said before, there were 18 kids auditioning, including me. Fast forward to the day of casting. I walked up to my school's theatre room where the corkboard was and read through the list to see who had gotten casted. Literally every single person who auditioned for a role got one EXCEPT ME. I was so upset.
There was also this person on Instagram holding an art trade or something similar. Wanting to be involved, I sent them my art. They responded by saying, ""sorry, your art isn't what I was looking for""....way to politely tell me I wasn't good enough. I was upset. Roughly 5 or 6 years working hard at art, only to be told that I wasn't good enough.

Last year when COVID was still raging and everything was all virtual, my school held an all-virtual play. My teacher made us write this play as a group. Every time I tried to pitch an idea for this play, my ideas got shot down and replaced with another, better idea. Other people's ideas didn't get shot down. Just mine. Soon, the time came to rehearse. I did my best at rehearsal, but I was, again, subtly told that my work wasn't good enough. Every time I came on, we had to start the scene over because I messed something up.

Fast forward to more recent times. I saw a play writing competition on Instagram, and I really wanted to join! However, I couldn't, because I'm not good enough, therefore my play would never get chosen. Another play thing came along, but this time, it wasn't a competition or contest. I still decided not to join, because, well, no one would like my stupid plays anyway. 

I'm also failing/barely passing half my classes even though I'm trying my best.

I give up. I'll just have to accept that I'll never be good enough at anything. Not theatre, not art, not school, nothing. I'll just never be good enough no matter how hard I work.",depression,2021-12-08 18:16:08

391,rbxi5x,Nothing,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbxi5x/nothing/,0,"

On November 1 2021, I lost everything. 

I had a home that has been in the family for 19 years. In 2017 my mom was going to let it go back to the bank as she retired. So I tried everything I could to save the land and home. Her bank would not refinance it back to me.

Being that this was 2004 Mobile home with 3 bedrooms on 5 acres not many lenders I applied with, wanted to deal with it. There was affidavit of fixture on the home so it could never be moved again.

I tried national and local lenders. One credit union was going to lend using ‘Portfolio lending’ until there was no ‘data plate’ on the trailer. (Data plate was taken off when affidavit of fixture was issued). I was in a bind and wanted to keep this property for there is a lot of sentimental and physical value to my home.

A friend of mine offered to give me a land contract for 2 years to try and get financing on the property. I paid $5000 down to him and he took over the rest ($49,000 @ 8% interest).

In February of 2020 the land contract owner met me to renew the contract in which he lowered the payment, and I kept payments on time. Then in May of 2020 covid hit and I was told not to make a payment for May. Everything shut down in Michigan including the real-estate office I made the payment. The Land contract owner did not answer my text and when I finally saw him in October of 2020 he made it clear he wanted me to purchase the contract. He was sick with stage 4 cancer and told me to use the money to buy the place so his family did not have to deal with it.

He went ahead and filed a court order to ‘Forfeit’ the land contract for non-payment. The judge said he had to right to stop contract at any time.  I had pre approval through a national company and even paid for an audit of the property. They wanted $64,000 and it was valued at $129,000. When I asked for a bill of sale the land contract owner sent it to his lawyer and the lawyer sent the court papers. Instead of a bill of sale. The underwriter saw court papers (which I told the lender it was in forfeit) and backed out of the mortgage.

I asked for a USDA rural development mortgage but they cannot lend to anything on a mobile home older than 2006. FHA would not lend on it either. Later I found out that Fannie nor will Freddy lend on a mobile home that had a previous address. My mom did get the house on the property in 2008 from a repo sale in Zeeland MI. I bought it on land contract in 2017. So no national lenders would back the home or property.

During the time to come up with the money to buy the land from the contract owner. He passed away and his wife took the contract over and handed it to her son. I could not come up with the money and they refused to negotiate another contract. I am homeless now as of November 2 2021.

My family has been living hotels and Air B+B places weekly. My savings in getting really low and I am only living off of what my job pays. My wife cannot work due to covid and needs to see a specialist for her pain syndrome. My son is staying at my Dads home so he can get to school on time and finish out the school year.

Now the Holidays are coming upon us and we are homeless and struggling. We have applied for apartments and there are only waiting list we are on. We have paid application fees and numerous searches on the internet. We have started a go fund me hoping to keep a float during these troubling times. There are nights we need to sleep in my car and keep starting it to stay warm.

I cannot go on like this and feel that everything I encouraged others to do in life to succeed. Has all imploded on me and I have no resources or means left to succeed in life. I am supposed to provide for my family and here I am a 45 year old man that cannot even provide a roof over their head. My wife is sick and I cannot be there so she can feel better. I sound like a beggar asking for help and I guess I am. But I feel that the man I once was, successful and happy that man is now gone. I have no hard feelings against the land contract owner. Just was a bad deal and timing. I have tried to get a mortgage and I am told my credit is not high enough. I looked at my credit report and I have no open collections or past due. One creditor says I have 649 another says 618.

I love my job and that is the only thing I have going for me. I am a man with no future or hope I feel.

I have the feeling that I’m near the edge of a positive breakthrough, but due to a few events, it’s all slipping away again.

My work doesn’t want to help anymore. I have been officially removed from the company wide communication groups even though my contract doesn’t expire till the start of March. And the care system that is supposed to help me only covers their own asses. I already had a strong feeling I wasn’t welcome anymore but since they didn’t include me in their Christmas gifts and now completely shut me out of all communication, I’m very sure of it. 


Anyway, long story short. Because of this setback I have been feeling really down lately and this feels like yet another failure in my book. I don’t know how to tell my environment that I’m back to struggling again and I’m very afraid and ashamed. I’m only 26 and I am scared of the road that lays ahead of me.

But I just don’t want to go trough it all again. I need a reset that doesn’t destroy me and let me build my life back up instead of breaking it down.

i apologise for the potential mistakes in this post, i'm french and english ain't my mother tongue sooo, yeah.

i was wondering about something, see, yesterday i had a really weird day. i spent the evening with my significant other and it felt like everything i was feeling was made 5 times more intense. i am not talking about anything sex related, i'm just saying that the simple feelings of love and affection became more intense for no reason ? i don't think i've ever felt this way, after the years of depression and numbness induced by my medication it felt like i was reborn or something.

anyway i know what you must be thinking ""why on earth are you posting on r/depression if your life is so great??"" well. yesterday night, i told myself that i wouldn't be taking any more meds since i feel so great now. 
i've been ""playing"" with my doses of medication over the last week or so and to sum it up i only took 1/3rd of my dose over the last week. just now i felt nauseous and i'm wondering if it's the repercussion of not tapering down my dose enough and stop taking my meds pretty brutally.
should i keep taking a low dose everyday and eventually stopping completely in a few weeks or should i persevere  in the ""no meds"" policy ?

PS : i know i should be telling this to my psychiatrist but last week they told me to keep taking my meds for 3 more months even though i told them that i was doing relatively great and wasn't feeling depressed at all for the last 6 months. i feel like my meds are holding me down, i don't have any libido anymore and it sucks tbh. anyway, i'm kind of a coward and i don't feel like telling my psychiatrist that i've stopped taking their prescription without their avail so i'm asking strangers on the internet if i should keep doing my thing.

I have such a loving family and girlfriend but I still feel hopeless. I've been on 20MG paxil for 6 years and just recently got boosted to 30mg because I started to feel really anxious in September. Last week would have been my 10 weeks on the new medication and I did see some benefits while going through the 10 weeks. But now that I am getting these feelings back I'm really scared the medication is not going to do the trick.. My psychiatrist added 150mg Wellbutrin to my 30mg Paxil just this Monday. I haven't felt much of a difference yet and I am worried I am going to have to wait another 10 weeks to see if this will even work.... Then if it doesn't I am back to square one for the third time. 

I have been looking for a counselor that will fit me well, I am open to talking about my feelings. Has anyone gone through these issues before? I could really use some insight on how changing medications has worked for some of you.",depression,2021-12-08 19:39:04

405,rbs1t0,I have no good qualities,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbs1t0/i_have_no_good_qualities/,2,"After constant romantic and professional rejection I’m (32m) just realizing I have almost no attractive qualities, or at least that traits that are commonly desired by women. And that’s really all I want out of life, to have a partner (and of course that needy mindset makes me more unattractive too).

I used to work out but it never really helped with women so I stopped doing once I realized I wasn’t really doing it for myself. I run occasionally but it doesn’t make me less depressed. I have dated and had some flings and brief relationships but they always dump me. I’ve never really received any compliments besides being “cute.” And obviously that’s not enough. I’m not ambitious. I used to be but that didn’t make me much more attractive either. I used to be hardworking and disciplined but I’m not anymore because none of my hard work has paid off. So the only upshot to hard work for me is that occasionally it takes my mind of things but brings no tangible or financial payoff. I’m not confident, funny, assertive, extroverted, mentally tough, etc. 

The only two things I can think of that I genuinely like about myself are that I’m kind (I try to see the best in people, build them up, and encourage them, polite, etc). Basically just nice guy bullshit but as I’m constantly reminded that’s not special and not enough. I’m smart but in an intellectual, philosophical, contemplative way. Not street smart or smart in a way that will translate into a financially stable career which most women undeniably want from men. 

So the only way to find someone is by acquiring more attractive traits and undertaking the monumental task of changing my personality which will take forever and honestly I don’t want to find love at 40 or 50 or 60. Plus, the changes would all be fake and not true to myself. 

TL:dr I have more negative qualities than positives and need to radically change my personality if I want to be attractive but that will take forever so I probably won’t find love.",depression,2021-12-08 19:33:58

I started to question why. Is being alone even a bad thing to begin with? Yea sure no one cares about me but that also means I dont have to care about anyone else(not in a crazy psychopathic way but a Ron Swanson kind of way). Honestly, other people can be a hand full. I want no part in their drama or their problems. People can lift me up but they can also kick me when I am down, with the latter being more prevalent. So why should I surrender the control of my life and my happiness to other people. Yes, the shell that I have built around me is so thick that only I can hurt me, but conversely the opposite is also true, and that is, only I can make myself happy. 

Why is connection so important? Why is the lack of connection sad? When I play any single player role-play games I can do whatever the fuck I want and have a good time while doing it. Why not treat life that way? ....within the realm of the law of course.

Is any of this revelation true? Fuck do I know... maybe it is just a ramblings of a drunk loner. But what I DO know is that thinking this way just now made me feel better.

I’m instantly back to feeling terrible even if I’m on what should be a nice vacation.

You know when you’re in a group of “friends”? And they’re all having fun but you’re kind of just on the sidelines? You can tell that they don’t want you there but they’re not gonna tell you that. You can kind of just tell that your presence isn’t wanted. Sometimes they say “can you leave for a second?” Or “you don’t HAVE to come with us”. It hurts so much because I can tell that my “friendships” are fading apart and that I’ll be back to square one again. The best way I can think to describe this is the scene from Skins when Effy and Julie go out and Effys having fun with people and Julies kind of just left there like “I thought we were here together!”

None of this makes sense I know. But I’m just wondering… does anyone else get this?",depression,2021-12-08 05:12:56

My life of abuse and self hatred that no one will read.,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbt7fe/alone_yet_not_alone_my_life_of_abuse_and_self/,2,"I don't know where to start with this.  I am scared to post anything at all. Scared to try and open up about myself and my thoughts. So where to begin? I'm 29. Male. Married for 6 years with two beautiful 6 year old twins (boy and girl). Me and my wife are almost debt free and are officially saving up for our first real home. My kids are the sweetest and smartest children you have ever seen and are just beyond cute and quirky. Life doesn't sound so bad. Yet I can't stop the crying. The thoughts of ending everything. The feeling of loneliness. I have always suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. Never had a dad. A sperm doner sure. But he was a horrible evil man and I'm glad he was never part of my life. But the men who my mom did end up with over the years where pretty bad too. I was two years old when my mom met my first step dad. My little brother was born when I was 4. I can remember even back then how well he treated me..until my brother was born. I went thru years of abuse after that from him. It was beatings every day he was home (he was a truck driver and sadly not a long haul one. My own mom used to tell people how terrified I was at him coming home. How I would run immediately toy room to make sure it was perfect and how even as a child he would hog tie me, drag me across carpet giving me massive carpet burns and beat me. She used to try and defend me. After she finally left him, he told me the reason he treated me the way he did was because I wasn't his blood son. Come to find out he also assaulted my sister who was 4 years older then me along with his blood daughter around the same age. I was 9. A few months later she was remarried to a Costa Rican guy. While I was growing much faster at this point, he never laid a hand on me. Instead, it was a bunch of mental abuse. Alot of not letting me eat because I fell asleep while they where out. Or knowing I'm deathly alergic to yellow jackets and making me wait 3 hours on deaths door for my mom to get home before taking me to the hospital. Alot of telling me no one would ever love me or want me in their family. How worthless I was. To make things worse, my mom at this point was taking his side over every thing. I was never overweight as a kid but I did have a slight tummy. Like if someone that would have had abs was just 20-30 pounds heavier. So not bad. But constantly getting called fat by your step dad hurts. I would go swimming with my shirt on (still do). Was afraid to do any sports as I got a bit older because I didn't want to have to take my shirt off in front of others. I started hating myself. Blaming myself for everything. But at least I had friends. It was 9th grade when I got my first girlfriend. We where both in NJROTC. Took her to the naval ball we did that year. Later on I was asked by someone after joking around with her (she left to go to class) what I did to his girlfriend (talking about her). Turned out she was cheating on me. Back them I was stronger. Just said fuck it and broke up with her on the spot. Found out she had been sleeping with multiple guys and even doing things with them on the bus. Dodged a bullet I did. I was still in 9th grade tho. Just got out of school and was waiting to get picked up by my mom. No one else in school except my NJROTC teacher who was the only one that seemed to believe in me. I checked my phone to see whyy mom was running late and got a message from her saying 'say goodbye to your friends. We are moving today. I'm leaving him.' I was heart broken. I had so many friends that I had no way of keeping in touch with yet outside of school. Cellphones and minutes where still super expensive back then. I lost almost everyone that day as we moved suddenly to another state. My mom had a new boyfriend 2 weeks after we moved there. This one seemed cool but it wasn't long before he was throwing me to the ground over my cheap flip phone. I had told the school counselor how unhappy I had been and they talked to my mom about it. She got mad and tried to take it away and I refused to give it to her. He was there and decided if I wouldn't give it voluntarily then he would take it by force just a month into their relationship. I was 14 and being tossed around by a grown ass man in his late 30s/early 40s. There was alot of that over the next few years. Alot of being thrown thru walls. Having my eye busted open at his parents house (his parents defended me thankfully. His dad beat the shit out of him that night cuz I was 15). Alot of 'you will never have a father.' which hurts it still hurts all these years later. My sister had moved out a few years prior to live with her dad. She tried to commit suicide several times. I went into two group homes when my mom was with him. I didn't get to graduate due to being a borderline student and the public school refusing to allow to enroll no matter how high my test scores where. Thankfully I enrolled in a GED program which got me my GED before I would have graduated normally. At 18, I moved out. Moved all the way to main where a girl I had let online a family promised to help me find a good job working with her dad. I get there and come to find out he worked thru a temp agency. The pay was good but the cost of living in main negated the pay. I was there for 2 months before they got a divorce and I was forced to quit and move to Alabama with them. Things where fine at first. Me and the girl where dating. But when we got there, all anyone did was smoke weed and fight. I was the outsider tho so they turned on me. Turned out she was cheating. I was kicked out and they moved the new bf in same day. Stoleost my stuff. I had no choice but to move back in with my mom and that same boyfriend. Except this time, things had got worse at home. Her had started doing it all to my little brother. Now that I was back he let up and started on me again. I didn't stay long. Every relationship I had since I was 14 up to this point I had been cheated on and used. So my self confidence was rock bottom. And this was all 2011. One and a half years after I got my GED. I was 19. Found this girl who I was in love with when I was younger. We started dating and she even moved me in with her when I was struggling. I was madly in love with this girl. Had been for a long time. One day she tells me she's going to go see family up north for a week and that she would be back soon. I was fine with that. But then I started to see things. Hear things. Post in her Facebook about her going to new Orleans for Mardi gras. I asked her about it and she swore she was going north to see family. More things like that kept popping up tho leading up to the trip and I started to feel uneasy. I knew her ex lived in new Orleans. Her ex of several years that she was in bad for before me. It was 2 days into her trip when she called me and told me she was in new Orleans and staying with his family in their camper to save money but he didn't live there with them and she wasn't going to see him...I knew it was a lie...but I was in love and wanted to believe her. To trust her. She finally came back from her trip and we had a nice dinner and made love (I didn't lose it to her. That happened in 10th grade few years prior). But I woke up to her phones ala going off that next morning. Her dumbass self tho had it to where her phone would show previews of text messages you got and when I turned her alarm off, all you could see scrolling across the screen was 'i love you so much and miss you babygi......'. so yeah...I looked and read. It was his camper. They had been sleeping together. He didn't even know I was still in the picture. I felt disgusted. A huge fight broke out. I left. Back to my mom's again. From there I moved to main with a friend. Got a job and tried to start a life for myself. My friend was a girl but we didn't have those kinds of feelings. She had a bf and I came to like one of her friends up there. Come to find out tho that my friends friend like me too and my friend knew it. She got jealous and kicked me out. This time my mom said 'he doesn't want you here'. So began the real struggle. I bounced around and finally ended up at another friend's house. This time a guy. He lived with his mom still and his brother and sisters even tho he was in his 30s at this point. But while I was there, I got into a wreck. A bad one. My back and left shoulder are still hurting to this day. I was driving one of their piece of shit cheap cars tho when I got in the wreck and it was 'pay 3x it's kbb value or get out'. I paid it. They still kicked me out. Now the one good thing that came from my relationship with the new Orleans cheater was that she introduced me to something on the computer called IMVU. (This was before it was ruined and turned into a site where you can only find people trying to catfish others and have virtual sex. Back when there was vast amounts of Roleplaying going on like D&D). On there I had made some friends. And one of those friends offered for me to love in with her and her bf in Oklahoma. Another person I met on there became a long distance gf. Well when I moved in with my friend, he crazy bf and her split up. I had asked her if my gf from our little online guild could move in with us and that we would pick upore of the bills to help her. She agreed and thusy gf and future wife moved in. But then something bad happened to my friend. She worked 3rd shift at the gas station beside the house. She got robbed. And shot. She lived but she was out of work for a couple months. Unemployment pays less then you usually made so bills got tighter. She got bitter and angry and jealous. To this day I don't blame her. But things went south and weoved out. Life started to get better fe this point on tho. Me and my gf got married. We have two beautiful children. Boy and girl. They are twins. I got a job working for Athens Clarke county in GA. Great city government job. Easy with wonderful pay and benefits. My wife was on track to become bakery manager at a Publix where she would have been making 3x my pay. We got a new car. (Well a used 2014 but it was from carvana and had less then 30k miles on it). We where also about to start saving for our first house. But even then, I still seems to suffer from severe depression at times and feelings of wanting to kill myself. But then my mom came to me. By this time she had left her bf that abused me and was in a much healthier relationship. She told me her dad and her had been talking for the first real time in her life since she was a child and he wanted her to move in with him. He was old. A amputee and going thru a divorce. He also had the beginning stages is dementia. Said he wanted his family near him. He said he wanted us too. That he would give us the other house on his property. We agreed. Like idiots. We gave up our careers and moved to TN. Got into a wreck day 1 of being there because we didn't know the roads. Turned out the house he gave us was a 14 year old double wide trailer. He didn't give us the land it was on tho like he had said. He met a druggy tho a month after we all moved up there. She was moved in 3 months after we got there. Kept lying to him saying she was a RN. Took control of his meds. Slept in the same room. Constantly in his ear. This was before we found out her and her son where meth heads. But we started to see signs something was going on. They then turned on my mom. Got her kicked out. They got married and then turned on us. Only we where harder to get rid of. The trailer was in our name and they wanted it back. They also didn't want to pay for it so they decided to cut our power and water off them take us to court saying we forged his signature on a stolen title. Things just went bad so fast. We had to put up with it for two years. Have our kids move in with my mom where she was when our utilities where cut off because it was mid winter and covid had the government shut down. 3 moths later we finally got everything sorted in the courts and could go get our kids. On the drive there, I stopped for gas. My wife was passed out and her phone stated ringing. It was a call over a app called discord. I hit ignore so she wouldn't wake up. Her friend could wait. But upon opening discord to tell him she was sleeping....I found out she was cheating on me with him. Nothing in person. But the way they spoke to each other. The calls they had when I was at work. The pictures.....I almost killed myself right then and there. I still have screenshots of it all. To wrap this up. We are still together. Because I would kill myself if I was alone at this point. I'm miserable most the time. I try not to think about things. We live in Arkansas now. My job sucks. Upper managment is why. Store manager and employees are great. Wife is a CNA now. We are finally able to trade in our a to b cheap car we got after the wreck come this tax returns and get a decent vehicle again. Then we can start saving for a house again. And things are not always so bad here. My kids bring me so much joy. Me and my wife have worked thru alot of things. She even quit alot of social media over the cheating thing. She just has Facebook now. 'to rebuild my trust in her' as she says. But idk. Idk what to do. It's been almost two years since I found out she was cheating on me. I still love her. We are pretty happy together. But I just feel like most the time, I can't shake this sadness. This loneliness. I have no friends either. A couple online ones sure..but they make it known that it's strictly gaming only. They don't really care otherwise. My wife has always lacked...intimacy. she tries from time to time but we have had arguments over how she never touches me. Never makes a move. How I can make it obvious I want her and il get told no or ignored most of the time. I feel alone. So alone. I don't want to be alone anymore. Even tho I am not alone with my wife and kids. I just..don't know how to continue on. I want to live...not just exist. And if I have to just keep existing and not living...I would rather not exist at all.",depression,2021-12-08 20:31:01

440,rbowl0,i don’t know what to do with my life,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbowl0/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,1,"to preface, i get this is a feeling that many people have, but i just want to get my feelings out and rant yk

i’m a freshman in college and despite having not declared a major, there’s immense pressure to choose one as soon as possible. my parents tell me that it’s okay and the time to figure it out, but how am i supposed to live and plan a life that i haven’t wanted to live for so long.

about six months ago, i suddenly lost my sister, who also happened to be my best friend. seeing how it destroyed my parents and pained so many people (including myself haha) has forced me to come to terms with the fact that suicide isn’t an option anymore. 
leaving home has been helpful with my grieving process, but i still suffer with depression in general, along with that grief. since i had planned to end it, i had never really pursued anything as a concrete career for myself. 
now, i’m around so many people (also freshmen) who have so many plans and ideas, passions. i don’t, and haven’t ever, had something that makes me feel that way. 
everything that i find myself enjoying is impossible to turn into a stable career. i love love love art, but careers like graphic design aren’t for me, as i only do traditional art, and i’d prefer to just spend my time developing my skills as a hobby rather than something with the pressure of supporting my life financially. as i go to a college in the pnw, i’ve come to really enjoy foraging for mushrooms and spending time with nature. 

one would tell me to turn that into a career as a mycologist, but again, i would want that as something i do to enjoy myself in my free time. ideally i would live right near a forest, and spend my days creating art, reading, cooking, gardening, and foraging, without the constant pressure of my life crumbling without money. i just don’t see how i can be happy with a future where i’m working a 9-5, unable to spend time on those things that are important and joyous to me.

another dilemma of mine, is the inevitable threat of climate change. this related to my career stress in that i feel like i have to do something within environmental science because if i won’t, who will? and what would a major like law or business do when our society as we know it collapses? (theoretically though, i’ll be quite a bit older) i really just wish that our world valued human life, art, beauty, and nature, over profit and material gain. 
growing up and realizing how terrible living under capitalism is, is so painful. especially without any passion which could be considered in demand, and high paying. 
i have so many more thoughts in my head about this, as i’m sure so many of us do; but the point of this rant isn’t to fix these problems, is it? 

everytime i mention my frustration and sadness with the system (not even to mention how it oppresses minorities) and how i’m expected to live and work my life away, it’s just met with the response of “thats your depression, therapy will fix it”
and that’s terrible to hear. it’s partially what has kept me from seeking therapy again, because they just don’t understand, and nothing they can say will change my situation. i’m so scared of working a miserable job that i hate, because i am barely surviving while only in school. 

then the other half of me wants to scream and knows that yeah, without the depression, i would be successful, and i would maybe have a passion, but how can i be not depressed in a society like this. depression really does ruin every part of your goddamn life. i’m watching life pass me by, and i just wish i didn’t feel like this and live in a world this shitty. seriously, there’s so much wrong with what humans have done to this world and i cant do anything about it. other generations were never subject to this much exposure to it, and knowledge about how bad it is. 
i don’t want to have to deal with life stressors of adult life and money. everything that i’d love to do, and value, requires money. why cant we just take care of eachother and do what we love? FUCK capitalism dude. why do i have to pay to live.",depression,2021-12-08 16:32:54

My life, I feel at times has come to nothing. I think a lot these days about when I was young and I did not have to care about the things I do today. I am fat, ugly, and feel I have to please everyone I meet. I think a lot about why I feel this way. Is it trauma from a past event?

People I talk to today, I feel I can never talk to about my feelings as I feel they could never relate to what I am feeling. I feel trapped as I no longer have the hope or excitement that I once did. I smoke to get a dopamine kick out of my day or to try to connect with those lost feelings of hope and excitement that I once had. Its so hard man. When I talk to people, I feel a constant sensation that they do not want to be with me because of the way I look. And people say to me just dont care, but they just don't understand. 

I felt hopeful after high school going into college. But i lost belief in myself when I realized that I am always going to be that loner kid who can't socialize, says stupid things, is ugly. Sometimes, I like holding onto these feelings of despair and hopelessness as it relieves me of the future pain from going out to meet people and socialize. In my mind, I know that people will feel uncomfortable around me, so I just don't say anything-- so I just stay in bed, in my room, with my computer. 

I used to be such an outgoing guy, excited to make people laugh in my presence. I wasn't afraid. But so many things have happened since then. I reject that part of myself now but then again, at times, I also want to be that part of myself. 

I just want out of everything sometimes. I sleep but wake up feeling exhausted. School gives me anxiety. I worry when I close my eyes. I have these goals but don't have the patience to accomplish them. 

I obsess most importantly on my social interactions. I want to find love. I want to have a girlfriend and a friend who will love me no matter what. 

But I can't even accept me for who I am. I flake on people because I can't envision them ever accepting me. It makes me sad. 

I feel alone, so alone at times. I want to be alone so I can fix myself. The pain of the thoughts are slow jabs.

I was obese all my life and when I finally lost all the weight and was fit, I thought I would be accepted finally. College came and I still could not take that leap of faith to start believing in myself entirely. Now, I look at myself and want to fix myself, because the pain of rejection is too much. I gained all the weight back. 

Dunno who I am anymore. I'm lost and can't sleep.",depression,2021-12-08 14:18:49

I moved back to my hometown into my parents house with my toxic step father. I am 31 now and the last 3 years have been a complete waste of my life. I’ve had two jobs, but I spent most of the time being isolated and sedentary. I finally moved out of my parents house and now I’m living alone.

I don't even wanna share those mental shits with anyone, cuz it makes me feel bad and guilty, why should I make someone feel sad about my mental situation while im already suffering from depression ？

I know all those theorises about how you should fight against depression but I just couldn't act ！just like a guy who broke both of his legs and he just couldn't fucking walk, and those ones around him just keep telling: ""be strong and learn to walk "" 

man, imma losing my mind, depression doesn't kill me like a bullet through the head but it kills me everyday, holding a knife and everyday slice a piece of meat of my flesh ,then I got numb while bleeding and suffering 

I don't wanna off myself, but it's just damn painful from inside

449,rbbkjd,My life ended after I graduated,15,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbbkjd/my_life_ended_after_i_graduated/,10,"If I had just died after receiving my diploma, I would've been fine with it.

&#x200B;

In essence, the time I spent in school & college was the only period in my life where I felt something resembling ""happiness"". I had friends who shared the same (narrow) interests, I had something to work towards, there was always a ""next project"" or another interesting problem to solve. This was the only time I had friends and something resembling a social life. I could almost pass as a person in that context.

&#x200B;

I have been a misfit my entire life. I was the kid who preferred to read books during recess instead of fooling around. During vacations I just spent ridiculous amounts of time reading -- or working on technical projects that are never completed and never see the light of day.

&#x200B;

I thought I would be ready for society once I finish my degree. Then I thought I would be ready when I finish my masters'. I was wrong. I wasn't ready. I was never going to be ready. I was never going to fit in.

&#x200B;

I have (and have had) jobs programming for large companies where I manage to repress my anxiety just enough to pretend to be a functioning, productive adult. But there is no goal, nothing interesting, nothing. It's always just the same every day - the details of the projects may differ superficially but they're the same. Same discussions with project management, same problems, same types of people. There is no difference between projects and between one day and the next.

&#x200B;

The only reason I am still here is because I have to take care of two elderly parents. And because I have some books in my backlog I want to read. Otherwise, I have no goals and nothing to look forward to. I've had one girlfriend during college once, but that's about it - never had any since. There is really no point in my existence.

&#x200B;

A recurring thought I have is how it would've been better if my life just ended after graduating. It goes something like this: I just go to pick up my diploma on a sunny summer day, then experience a few final moments of happiness after having achieved something of note (however marginal), then just fade away and disappear right there. Other observers might be a bit confused seeing a person disintegrating into pixie dust right then, but I would've been okay with it. Perhaps it would look a bit funny and I would've given a few people something interesting to see on the way out.

&#x200B;

It has been 4 years since then and I am starting my fifth year of being just another hollow human being without goals or aspirations. I do not enjoy what this society offers and will likely never enjoy it. The only reprieve from anxiety and existential dread are the few hours I spend at night reading and browsing reddit before falling asleep. It feels like I've used up most of the ""happiness quota"" in my life and that the rest of my existence is just a footnote.",depression,2021-12-08 04:10:28
450,rbnm8q,!!TW: Suicidal; Self Harm!,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbnm8q/tw_suicidal_self_harm/,1,"I’m 17.
It’s so hard. Been having hallucinations for the first time in a while, eye twitching, and severe anxiety to the point I can’t leave my room even for school etc. my lack of motivation has visited and stayed. My whole arm and other parts covered with 50+ scars and recent self harm injuries.

I want to leave this world but then I end up laughing because all the methods of dying seem to hurt. It’s not that I want to be hurt, I just want to leave for good. 

I’m thinking of being dehydrated for 72-80 hours, or overdosing on my mom’s type 2 diabetic medicine even though I’m not diabetic, etc. These voices won’t stop and I hate myself, I sometimes wish I wasn’t a girl, I don’t feel like myself, I have many issues and I’ll even afraid to share with my therapist who I get to meet once every two-three weeks. I get haunting flashbacks and I easily lose control of my emotions, there was a time where I recorded myself throughout the night. From what I saw, I sort of lost touch with reality, I’d get up from bed wide awake and talk to myself, looking at things in my room as if I’ve never seen them, I’d also stare at the walls and feel them, etc.

I want to runaway and sometimes I think of how lucky some people are for being kidnapped, I hate myself for thinking like that. I have severe unwanted thoughts, like how someone I love will leave me and if I should just never get into close relationships, I think of drugging and tying if anyone I love chooses to leave me or cheat. I feel disgusted with myself. 
I’m a fool who finds loving one person for life enough. 

I don’t want to die alone but I have no choice. If someone would love me forever, I’d keep living until both of our last breath.
I feel desperate and paranoid. 

I’m just ending it. Bye",depression,2021-12-08 15:05:24

452,rbr1nq,Don't know what to do,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbr1nq/dont_know_what_to_do/,2,"Hey everyone. I'm 17(M) and I honestly don't know what to do/think anymore. To break it down I'm basically gonna give  a format on what I think about a lot. So to begin with me and my dad don't have a good relationship. Very mental abusive and sometimes it got physical. He once put me in a chokehold in the middle of my zoom class so that wasn't so fun. Moved in with my mom on my first day of senior year. My dad I guess is very mentally abusive according to my sister but I have no clue because I might just simply ignore that but my dad had cancer and that was a trip. Said all types of stuff that no kids honestly should hear. So once I move out my dad calls me again basically wanting a relationship and telling me he has cancer once again. He tells me that he wants a relationship cause he can die anyday(he's  66) and I basically told him if I'm suppose to feel bad/sad for him. He took advantage that he had cancer last time so I didn't feel bad for him at all. He goes on saying why we hate him so much and I say it's probably because of all the mental abuse he has given all of us to which he says we did the same so it's fair. This just made me angry but I didn't freak out but to say how he could say all of that and not think we wouldn't dislike him or hate him. He then says all the negatives about me and basically goes off to how he won't have a son/father relationship with me because of me. This just ruined my entire day and a few weeks. I was so devastated that I was planning on ending it all. My mom then blames my dad for my depression or sadness and tells me to block him which I do. This happened about 2 months ago. I'm still thinking about that a lot but other things about how much I hate myself. I feel like a total disappointment to everyone and it doesn't even need a reason why. I just have to see myself in the mirror and it would make sense why. I feel like no one really likes me/care for me they just feel sorry for me. My mom loves to say how much she's sorry for leaving me and I say it's fine because what can I do, the past is the past. Recently I decided to tell her my issues and she just goes on to say how her life was worse when young and I should be happy. She's Vietnamese so she doesn't understand English well and I understand she isn't trying to hurt me but it just hurts still. I've told her to stop doing that like a day ago but I got no one else to really talk to.  She doesn't understand that I just hate myself so much and I don't care what anyone says because im just so hard headed I refuse to see how anyone can like me. I've told her about me being bullied when young a lot and I felt like I was never wanted. She just tells me to ignore them which I do but I can't ignore the feelings cause they come back always. I tried to get help by going to therapy and I haven't got a call from them at all. I just feel like ending it honestly but the only thing keeping me here is my mom. She knows I've tried and I don't want her to be sad. If my mom wasn't here i'm sure I would probably not be here. I've got no one else honestly. I feel like im alone always no matter what. Even young I know the real world and I've experienced some of it. I don't know what to do honestly. Just so tired ya know? Anyways thanks for reading and if you actually have reached here thanks.

I see a therapist and I’m on two different antidepressant medications. Somehow, it’s not enough. It’s defeating to think I will never escape this. And when you’re as fucked up as I am, people don’t love you.

I still haven’t taken the TSI which has stopped me from enrolling into math and science classes and i’m trying to take it before i attempt to enroll. I did relatively well this semester so i’m trying to appeal to receive financial aid again next semester. but i’m just so. exhausted. 

I won’t lie. I have so much anger and remorse towards my university because of the financial aid situation. I can’t help but feel like this is all their fault. but i know at the same time, i fucked up when it came to my classes. I feel like such a disappointment, being first generation and low income, i feel like i should’ve known better. I hate using my depression as an excuse but it just makes my life so much harder. 
All i want to do is go to school normally, and just have a path to succeed. i’ve been feeling suicidal all of finals szn because I feel like i’m not good enough. I feel like i should just die bc i will never be enough for this world. 
I applied for transfer for a school and i got in which was a dream come true, but it was too expensive. and I had to reject it. 
that sent me into a spiral of depression bc i truly hate attending this school. It’s my second year and i’m technically considered a freshman with the credits I have. and it just tears my heart apart that i’m so useless and sad. 
I don’t get why I have to go through this. Why life set me up like this, why i have to be so stupid and incompetent. 
I know i have options to leave the university, take a gap semester, work and go to community college but. it just just hurts. i’m so jealous of my friends who only have to worry about their class work. I try to talk about my feelings with them but they just don’t get it. They don’t know how it is to live in this world with depression. they don’t get why i’m suicidal. i don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t want to fight depression every single day.

When I was young, as young as I can remember I had a really difficult time distinguishing between the fantasy world I’d made up, and the real world. I’d force my cousins to play these elaborate games with me where we were different people in a different world. I’d started writing full books explaining this fantasy world at the age of 7 and by the age of 12 I’d had at least 10 full length books about it.

When I’d make my cousins “enter” this world as I’d call it, I’d beg them to keep playing for hours and when it came time to go inside and eat dinner, they simply couldn’t drag me back to reality. And I don’t mean I didn’t want to “stop playing a game” I mean I would be kicking and screaming and having a full blown meltdown if they called it a game and told me to stop. It was 100% real to me. I assigned each of my cousins and my brother a role in the world in which they were a character and I began to believe that these characters were real and that my cousins actually were them.

This was my entire childhood, and I know it wasn’t just childhood imagination, because it got so bad that I wasn’t allowed at my cousins house anymore, or at family gatherings. Sometimes it was other fake worlds other than the main one, like I’d hyperfocus on a show or movie and ask my cousins to pretend we were the characters, but once again by the time it was time to stop playing, I was fully convinced I was that character and that everyone around me was characters from the movie as well, and I’d have a meltdown if anyone tried to tell me otherwise. At one point I owned these crystals that played a big part in the world I’d made up, and my heavily religious grandmother made me smash them to pieces. I kicked and screamed and hit her and yelled that “the king” was going to kill me if they were destroyed. I thought that those crystals were the only thing allowing my real family to track me. I was around 11 at the time. 

I’m turning 19 next month and although I know now that THAT fantasy world is fake, it seems I just get lost in a different one now, but it’s no less severe. When I brought this up to one of my cousins a few months ago, she said it must have been a coping mechanism. I was severely abused since I was extremely young so it would make sense, but that doesn’t really help me understand anything. My cousin and brother told me that while playing these games I would claim to be people other than myself and would claim to not know who [my name] was. I have no memory of this, but my brother says I still do this which really terrifies me because no matter how hard I try, I can’t remember it. And admittedly it’s hard to believe he isn’t lying, though he has no reason to lie to me and has only ever wanted to help me. My memory is extremely poor anyways, but this is extremely distressing nonetheless.

I’m in an okay mindset at this moment which is why I decided to post this. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.",depression,2021-12-07 17:40:45

Or people just fall out of love. All that matters to the world seems to be sex and looking your best. I genuinely can’t think of something more heart breaking than being alive.

Started dating apps again 2 months ago. I've been ghosted and stood up to what I thought were potential matches. Last one hurt when I get to out date to find out she deleted her account and stopped texting me. Took myself on a date again, but I've already been doing that ever since my breakup and it's getting harder to enjoy the moment by myself. 

Took a family trip where I felt dragged into something I didn't want to be a part of. Engaging into their interests felt forced. I play music for them and I feel like a monkey on the street as drunk people throw money and yell ""play monkey play!"" As I put on a fake smile. Try to introduce them to something I like doing and they either give me the ""that's cute, we appreciate that you're interested in this"" or they just say no thank you. I'm outnumbered and I just become a wallflower. 

I feel stuck in a loop with my finances and career. The pandemic had me move back in with my parents. Got my job back in July with a raise and plenty of hours. Yet, I still don't have enough saved to move out on my own again. Prices went up on apartments and I don't have a fiance to help with the payments anymore. I just feel stuck, just hoping if I save more and wait a bit longer I can move out. My parents are completely ok with me staying as long as I need to, but I can't stand being their convenient son to help them with too many things. I just miss being on my own. 

My depression comes in waves, and I try to find the small things in life to enjoy in the mean time. But lately, I felt life has been giving me bad luck and taking the joy out of the small things I like. Want to do something creative?, Work or family needs you for something. Want to go out to eat or watch a movie?, Go alone like you've been doing for a while because your friends and family are too busy to join you. Matched with someone and the conversation is going well?, Ghosted. 

I miss being loved by a significant other. I wish my family truly appreciated what I like to do for fun. My friends are living their lives with work and relationships but I just wish they could hang out more or invite me to things. Overthinking really does hurt me, but I hope this depression wave stops carrying me out into the deep end lately. Sometimes I just want to walk and keep walking and let whatever take me far away from what I'm struggling with.

I was always afraid of him leaving me and I never quite connected it until I received a box full of records, a lot of them marked confidential, pertaining to the events leading up to DCFS taking custody of my brother and I. It was a lot to process. My mom stabbed my dad 9 times in front of us. The report also stated she was bleeding from the ears, eyes, and mouth with bruising on her neck. I'm trembling as I write this. The reports may have ended in Las Vegas but the real trauma that sicks with me happened in SC and got brushed under the rug. I've been abandoned at every turn in my life. When we were finally in a stable household with my biological Aunt, I was molested by her husband's father. I told my brother who told my Aunt. On the way to school (or maybe from I'm a little hazy on the memory) but I'll never forget what she said. I would ""hurt Uncle Wayne's feelings"" if I went around saying that. She told me not to sit on Papa's lap anymore and my brothers would watch out for me. And that was the end of that. I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. The shitty thing about it is I know I wasn't the only one he touched. But I was 6 maybe 7 at the time. So I carried it with me all the way to that bastard's funeral. I've only told a handful of people until now. Suddenly I'm reliving all the abandment. Being kicked out before I finished high school, being cheated on in every major relationship I tried to establish up until I met him. I was the happiest I've ever been. But it was always in the back of my head that I was going to lose him. So in arguments I would shut down. I was terrified of saying the wrong thing and had trouble even expressing my own feelings. And when the big argument came, I wasn't prepared. He was mad that I was friends with an ex, something he was aware of from the beginning, said it was okay and even met him at the dog park. If his feelings had changed, if he was uncomfortable I wish he would have just sat me down and said he was uncomfortable with it and asked me to block him. I would have in a heartbeat. But he started saying that my ex (who was visiting family with his gf) had bought a drone (this happened a couple of months ago) as a power move. He said it was like him saying ""look what I can get and you can't"" and he was sure of this because the particular drone in question was one they talked about me wanting at the dog park, and my ex said it was ""Chinese Spyware"" that his job wouldn't allow. It sounded silly to me that he was offended over my ex buying a drone. I gave my opinion: ""I think you're blowing it out of proportion"" Biggest fuck up of my life. I wish I realized what he wanted and offered to block my ex instead. There was literally nothing going on between us, he cheated then broke up with me years ago and I lost all feelings for him. But none of that mattered. The man I wanted to marry was over me because I took my ex's side. He called me unfaithful. He lied about driving my car into a ditch half a month prior to his parents. Then he tried telling me I asked him to drive when we both knew the truth. I told him no the first time and ended up letting him drive because I knew he was having a bad day. And he was in complete denial about it. It hurts more than I can put into words. I never wanted to lose him. And to make things worse he ended it on my last day of work. We were about to move to another state together. I had to listen to all my coworkers congratulate me and ask if I was excited. I felt a part of me die inside. I packed my ""new"" car (I went from a G35S to a Nissan sentra - like rubbing salt in my wound) and am now in a different state renting a loft from an old friend (we go back to middle school). Just before leaving my grandma gave me the box. She told me what it was and I took it anyway. I needed to know why I'm like this.

I (19F) have been living with my boyfriend (23M) since the summer, since the start of our relationship, I've noticed that he's very closed off emotionally and uses escapism to deal with almost everything; pretty early on we had this big fight where he went off on me for no reason, we talked and he said he would try going to therapy. He went to 1 or 2 sessions and decided he didn't like it; said the price was too high and he wasn't feeling such a big difference. I tried explaining that therapy takes time, and that in the beggining it will feel a lot like work, you're just being vulnerable and trying to find your footing within your mental space, and the price could be different with someone else, he might even like the treatment style more, but he didn't want to keep going either way. We settled on it, but I asked that he tried hard to comprehend himself and his feelings more even by himself, which he agreed on doing. 

A while has passed since then and I've noticed him becoming depressed since a while back, even before we move in together, but it did seem to get worse then. 

He's not interested in sex, he's always on edge (either sad or angry), most of the time he doesn't wanna talk about his feelings, whats going on or anything at all, even. He's been distancing himself more and more, and the few times he did talk about what he felt (and wasn't impatiently pointing that I don't understand what it's like for him, even though I ask and try reaching out constantly), he said he's unsure of his future, what to do with his life, if he's going to feel better at the new job (he currently works at a factory far from home and complains about the commute a lot, plus the job is stresseful and the pay is low, the new job is close to home and although has similar to a little more stress, pays quite a lot more), he always says that it doesn't have anything to do with me, that I'm one of the few happy thing in his life, so I don't know what else to do to help.

I've suffered with depression for a long time, and have been getting better in the last 2 years, having him around makes me super happy and I've never felt like this for anyone, so all I want to do is help him through it, but I feel like I have reached a point where I can't do anything else; I've been giving him space, suggesting activities to cheer him up, giving him support, telling him what helped me when I felt like that, but rarely has any effect, and it's very often temporary, next day or week he's back to feeling down.

I know for a fact therapy is the best thing he could do right now and we do have the money to pay for it, I even offered to pay myself or make the arrangements for him, but he doesn't want it. He always has an excuse, even saying he feels ''too down to go to therapy'', when that's exactly when he should be going. I've been studying psychology and going to therapy for years, and from what I observed about him, he's likely denying it because he feels like hiding it and escaping into games will help more than actually dealing with it; I told him sometimes the only way to solve something is going through it, and depression and trauma are just that, he understands it but doesn't seem to absorb it, or he rationalizes it in some way that just has him believing he can get better without therapy, or he just doesn't want to get better at all.

This is starting to affect me a lot, since I've been getting depressed along with him and I'm not sure how much more of this I can take without losing my progress. All I want is for us to be happy together, or at least happy.

529,rbmvow,I just got out of a short stay at the local psych ward,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbmvow/i_just_got_out_of_a_short_stay_at_the_local_psych/,0,"And while I personally did benefit from it as I was a lot safer in the units than in my dorms, and I even got access to immediate antidepressants and therapy free of charge while they work with me to find something more sustainable, I can't shake the feeling that it doesn't really matter in the end.

Nearly everyone on my floor knows about why I left and where I went for a few days, and even though some of them expressed their kindness (while some were just being extra nice), I feel like it doesn't really matter in the end. I already damaged my grades (I'm currently taking a break from reading the book that I was supposed to have read a while ago \[didn't have the money; no free version I saw\]) to the point that I'll probably lose my scholarship and make the already hard to afford tuition even more hard. And I found my current job too late. Even if I were to save everything and only spend money on ramen, I still don't have enough to cover tuition, let alone dorm fees (which are significantly cheaper than any apartment here) for this upcoming spring semester. I even went to do a shift just a few hours after I was discharged to still try and keep up. While time felt like it stopped in the hospital and I was just lost in thought, all the lost time is catching up and I'm still powerless to really do anything about it. I'm not even particularly excited about the therapy sessions because, to me, it is just another set of responsibilities that I have to do on top of the already strenuous list I have. Strenuous to me, anyway.  Realistically, I only have school and part time work, but having to regularly brush my teeth, floss, eat food, drink water, take a shower, take a pill at a specific time, maintaining your room, go to school on time, do homework, go to work, go back home, and even just making your bed seems nearly impossible. Nowadays if I go to school, I usually don't brush my teeth or eat anything or make my bed; I just go to sleep in the outfit I plan on wearing the next day so I can just get up and get out. On the days I go to work later in the day and night, I ought to be doing homework, but whether out of laziness or something else grabbing my attention, I just don't. I usually just eat a donut before work and, I generally forget about dinner until it already too late. Then I wake up too late, so I miss breakfast and generally lunch. I very rarely have days where I don't both go to school or go to work, and on those days I just lay around. Today was the first day I made dinner for myself, and I couldn't even finish it since I just wasn't that hungry (whether because of the antidepressants, or something else); it's so disappointing because I'm insecure about my weight, but I feel incapable of changing it. I'm encouraged to be social as much of my strife comes from my loneliness, but to be social requires opening yourself up for failure. Most days, it doesn't seem like a worth while trade off. I just end up either putting on a show to keep people around, or failing and bringing down the atmosphere and push people away. I think now that they know that I've been suicidal, they're much more tolerant and try being kind, but I honestly don't feel like I really deserve it. It shouldn't be their responsibility to tend to my feelings, nor should they feel the need to include me in their gatherings, but I usually end up feeling confused when they try. I try to do my best to ensure that everyone is accounted for, and they do gratefully acknowledge it, but I make it impossible to allow them to reciprocate for reasons unknown to me. There isn't a malevolent voice in my head telling me I don't deserve consideration, but just like how one may feel guilty for receiving expensive gifts, receiving the same kindness I may put out feels like incurring an impossible debt. Sometimes, I feel like a bad person for even attempting to create bonds with people, as if I were to kill myself, I'd violently and irrevocably rip that connection apart and leave them to deal with the consequences. It's presumptuous to believe anyone really cares to the extent that my parting would injure them, but it still worries me",depression,2021-12-08 14:14:48

This time was no different. It was so stressful and toxic that I have decided I never want to see him again. I fucking hate him. He can go fuck himself.

Well that sent me into a spiral of depression (his attitude) and I just couldn't cope. A vacation from work turned out to be even more stressful than work.

During this spiral, I've had to deal with my car being totaled. Renting a new car (with a severe lack of money). My finances were already a wreck and this did not help.

Work has been a little more difficult now, probably because I haven't had time to destress in order to get into the right mindset to deal with ridiculous and angry parents.

I'm starting to hate people again. Fuck society. We can all go to Hell.

540,rbia1a,Suggestions… Pls.,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbia1a/suggestions_pls/,0,"About 6 months ago it all happened…..

I was ending my junior year feeling great. I had just came off a great soccer season, I had done well in school, all my relationships with my friends we About 6 months ago it all happened…..

I was ending my junior year feeling great. I had just came off a great soccer season, I had done well in school, all my relationships with my friends were great, I felt great. I felt strong and powerful. I was working out everyday, I felt proud of myself. I was happy, I was grateful. This was in June 2021. This was about the last time i felt somewhat normal. 

Since then, it has felt like a downward spiral. During summer 2021 jun-aug, I had gone on many different vacations. Hawaii, and staying on a houseboat with my family. During these trips, I started feeling a bit different. I started feeling lower senses of self worth, and i became very hard on myself. I would run 10 miles at a time to prove to myself that I was fit. I would eat extremely healthy because if i didn’t, I would become a fat bum. I was obsessed with making sure I was fit, in shape, and made sure I followed a strict routine of staying in shape. I would look around me at people enjoying themselves, drinking beers, and I would think of them as lazy bums. I couldn’t stand to see that people were happy…

Seeing people happy made me even harder on myself. Seeing someone eat a burger made me livid, I just thought of them as a fat worthless person. I had to make sure I followed the most optimal diet. I stopped eating all the foods i enjoyed because I would become fat if i did and I would lose my 6 pack if i did. I had this attitude at thoughts 24/7 365 being cautious about EVERY meal. I would make sure to only eat healthy, I remember being hungry in the airport and not eating anything because none of it was organic. I didn’t eat for the whole day, even though i was hungry. I remember seeing my family eat burgers from counter, and just being so upset at the fact that i didn’t deserve one. I remember channeling my unhappiness into them, thinking they will be the ones who will pay once they are fat. I continued like this for a while, living this strict timid life being extremely concerned about my weight, nutrition, and looks. I thought i was doing everything right because i looked great on the outside and I was in shape. On the inside I was an unhappy person, living a life limiting myself to things i can enjoy. Summer of 2021 was coming to an end, it was august.

After this period came many different symptoms…

I started dealing with GI issues. Days would pass where I wouldn’t produce bowel movements, and I started noticing. I could go 4 days without producing a bowl movement. When I would produce a bowel movement, it was small and constipated. I tried fiber, staying hydrated, nothing helped. This irritated me a lot and I felt extremely uncomfortable. School was starting and I hated not being able to poop normally, i felt uncomfortable sitting down, walking, etc. Soon after this, I started dealing with more serious symptoms…... I lost complete sense of my appetite. Nothing looked or felt appetizing to me. I stopped eating, only eating sugar a couple times daily plus forcing myself to eat dinner. I couldn’t just skip dinner in front of my family every night. When I would eat, it would hurt my stomach and make me feel bloated. The only thing that wouldn’t hurt me would be bars, acai bowls, quick sugar foods. I still would workout after school as it was my daily habit, but this routine became extremely hard. Everyday started becoming extremely hard and challenging. I felt horrible fatigue all day, from the second i got up to the second I slept. Day after day, week after week. I was so anxious to live this life. Ever single morning I would wake up feeling fatigued and in pain and have to pretend like everything is ok. I became a pro at “pretending” my life is okay to my friends, family, and community. This made me incredibly anxious, I was pretending to live a life that I wasn’t living, and that was the worse part of it all. I would wake up feeling fatigued, anxious, and foggy, as well as in pain because of my stomach issues. I would go to school fatigued, in pain, and have to work all day. I wouldn’t eat at lunch and workout after school, then go immediately home, force myself to eat dinner with no appetite, and do it all over again. On weekends, I wouldn’t have the motivation to go out. My stomach just hurt and I was fatigued. When I would go out, I never felt well. At parties my stomach would extremely hurt from drinking even just a beer, plus I felt tired, anxious and just wanted to go home. It felt like I was living for nothing and I stopped finding enjoyment in almost anything. I was having to hold this all to myself and it was scary. After finally telling my parents about my stomach issues, they referred me to a doctor and a nutritionist. I had lost over ten pounds…..

Since my appointment with my nutritionist, i have been working to gain back my weight. I have been eating more real food (not just sugar) even though i have no appetite, I do it because i know my body needs it. She gave me supplements to help ease the pain of bloating and they helped, but i still don’t feel well. I wake up every feeling extremely fatigued. I have no desire to workout or play soccer, I force myself to because i don’t want to be perceived as lazy. It is hard for me to do the simplest of tasks in school but I do them anyway because i have to. I feel no sense of full comfort and constantly feel like there is something wrong. I haven’t felt my emotions, hunger, or happiness in a very long time. Everyday is a fight for me, and i do such a good job of covering it up to those around me, that almost everyone around me could suspect I am fully normal. I feel like I have been living underwater for the last 6 months, and it has been the greatest challenge I have ever faced. I’m confused because I still haven’t figured out weather I have depression, anxiety, or anything else that makes me feel this way, but i feel sick. I haven’t figured out my stomach issues. All i know is I will keep fighting everyday until i can feel better. Does anyone have things that helped them feel better?",depression,2021-12-08 09:39:07

I have a lot of friends but they don’t really care about me, they love to say they do, but I’ve never seen any of them one on one. Always has to be a whole group thing, I guess cause I’m probably so boring that no one can stand just hanging out with just me. I don’t think I’ve ever met a single person I thought I could count on. Everyone always disappoints me in the end. I’ve lost count with how much sex I’ve had with guys this year because if I could just feel wanted for just an hour or two then I could be okay.

It’s like every person I meet, they take one look at me and decide right then and there that I’m not worth the effort. And they’re probably right.

For the longest time my brother has been dealing with mental health issues. As of these recent years it has just gotten worse and worse. He deals with severe depression and is extremely irritable, aggressive, anxious and volatile. One day he will feel alright and the next he will be destroying something in the house. It is a vicious cycle and my family and I are at a loss for what to do. He is one of those extremely self aware types of people and despite knowing the fact that things will get better, or that he knows that will have great moments in life, he still resorts to wanting to kill himself because it’s “easy”. He knows he has to put in work to do what he wants to do but he simply sticks to the “can’t be bothered” or “too much effort” attitude and just thinks that it’s all pointless. He has tried to commit suicide multiple times and has gotten so much professional help but it just doesn’t work. My parents and I have tried to get him to open up but he either aggressively doesn’t want to or says that he doesn’t feel like talking even if I persist. He has also started drinking too, saying he wants to enjoy the “simple pleasures of life”. We are really exhausting our options regarding helping him but it just seems like he doesn’t want to help himself or put any effort into it. He’s getting more and more dangerous and I simply don’t know what to do anymore. We try not to force anything on him because any criticism or restriction such as taking away his phone or not allowing him to do certain things etc. makes him extremely angry. We’ve even had emergency services involved before too. As well as this his friends are probably a bad influence too, but restrictions don’t work on him and sometimes we have no idea where he goes. If anyone can provide any guidance or help or anything I would be really appreciative. Thank you.

549,rblis6,My drug,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rblis6/my_drug/,0,"  

I am very depressed. I have been for many years. I have wished I was dead more days than not for the past half decade. Depression is the worst thing in the world, no doubt in my mind. When I have severe feelings of pain when things are good it is like a war breaking out in a beautiful meadow. When I have the same feelings when times are tough it is like a war on top of another war. Going through life the only real and genuine way I have found to dealing with my depression in the long term is through avoidance. Avoidance sounds unhealthy but sometimes it is the right thing to do. When you do not want to deal with your emotions you can distract yourself, and sometimes by the time you finish your bad emotions are gone. What happens if they never go away? What happens when avoidance stops being a cure and instead becomes a painkiller? You start overdosing on painkillers. You start being fun and happy and make jokes every chance you get. You smile and laugh, and you get people to smile and laugh with you. In those moments, when you are the popular one, the confident one, the one people want, the pain goes away. For most people that feeling would carry on, but for me when the music stops, the demons in my head come back. The second I walk out of a door to go home I am either exhausted, drunk or wanting to kill myself.

Painkillers are good though, right? Even if it is not the end all solution it is better than nothing, right? The problem is that once you build that mask of who you are, it is hard to go back. If you want to reach out to someone, you can’t have it both ways. Are you going to be popular and feel relief, or annoy people and maybe find a way out of all of this? After years of trying to get out of this, I’ll stick with the relief for now.   
 But what happens when it gets worse? Because believe me, it is getting worse fast. What happens when you are so hooked on relief that you can’t find a remedy? I am not focusing on getting better, I am focused on getting my drug. I want to break that cycle, but I’ll probably take 4 more hits tomorrow and go to bed.",depression,2021-12-08 12:45:40

Now, I just feel hopeless and I have no idea how to change it. I'm unhappy, but I can't see any possible thing that could make me happy. It's like, objectively, I should be happy. I have nothing to be unhappy about, but here I am.

What do you even do? Every part of life is wearing me down, making me feel even shittier. Where do I go when I'm already where I wanted to be. I'm not happy now but I'm scared that if I make any big changes I'll just be even less happy. Fuck, I don't even know what is making me unhappy. I don't even know what made me happy back then.

Sometimes i just think to myself why am i like this, like why cant i never do or be anything good to anyone. I try my hardest to be okay but through the days and nights i just get worse and just end up back in the same spot i left off, i could never just do something right and leave it at that it always has to go and get fucked i dont mean for it to happen it just does and i cant help it. im just in the way of eveything everyone else, they have their life going on and im just waisted space that wouldnt really matter if it was here or not but idk. I just think it would of been alot better if i did get aborted like they wouldnt of had trouble with no kid or anything. 

I just dont feel like i deserve to be here like yeah i should be greatful for being here but there is alot of way better people that deserve to be here instead of me,i aint doing shit and its just wasting time, i want to be the best boyfriend i could be but i know im not ive always wished i had someone to just hold and make happy but i always fuck it up no matter what happens. I just sit here and cry and cry bc i dont want it to happen but it does im just not meant to have that love i guess,this girl maria is just so amazing she makes me feel okay but i just cause her pain and she needs nothing but happiness and love but im just a cold hearted fuck up idk why she picked me, i really aint nothing there are so many better people out there than me,i just want the best there ever is for her and its clear that im not that😔.... if someone ever reads this im sorry for everything in life,i tried to be okay but idk😔i always made it seem i was always happy to keep people from worrying and im glad people can remember that of me but every story must have an ending and well ill reach mine pretty soon i guess,i love all of you Aug,4,2019 

Sept,30,2019 i never make things better its just a thing ive always done, I mean to a certain point it just feels numb like and i just want to end it. I really love this girl,shes the best person ive ever met in my life she brings so much happiness into my life its unexplainable but everything i do makes her upset i always find a way to fuck everything up and thats how its always been. I dont want to die i mean this place is kinda cool but its just the way i am sucks, i try to give the best advice i can to help people and it helps but it never helps me and i could never help myself. Itlle be okay ,everything will be okay; a saying i always say to myself i try to convince myself itll be okay but it never is,i know it isnt and i just live with it. I wake up in the morning and just think fuck man like i could not wake up and itll be the same but once i get the good morning text from her it makes it better but as the day goes on i just find ways to fuck up and it just fucks up the whole night then i dream about just me not being here and how better it would be for everyone. idk man thats all i got for this time 

Oct,14,2019 i....i dont know...i can never be a good person to anyone😔,when i was younger i wish for someone just to hold and make feel so special in the world but now i just cant do it,im just too much of a fuck up to be anything good. I just dont feel anything right now so yeah there another goodbye wrighting in one of my art books so if you find that then thats cool too,i think im done wrighting stuff,its just not me 

Nov,6,2019 i want to fucking die. I want it to happen, for all of this to fucking end every single thing just fucking end. I dont want to see the sunraise and the sun set. Im not worth it none of this should of never been. 

June,12,2020 I tried to make my life okay,but I've just come to the realization that itll never be okay with in me,no matter who I have,I have the most beautiful and amazing person in my life right now and I cant seem to make it be okay,I try day in and day out to make things okay for us but like I've said before many many times im juat the never ending problem,I don't want to be the problem you know? But its just how it is,I don't think ill ever keep anyone happy enough to keep them for the rest of my life,i want her to be the one I lay my head to rest for the last time but I know she's get tired of it. I wouldn't blame her because I know its not easy to be with me,shit I mean I don't even want to be with me and I'm the same person. I haven't written anything in a while because I was trying to be okay in life but I can see its just all coming back,I lay here at night fighting myself to sleep while not wanting to wake up the next morning,going through the day is if I'm just watching it blow right by my eyes,im just tired of myself and who I am,I just love this girl so fucking much man like fuck,anything good in my life always goes to shit bc of how much of a fuck up I am.i just want it to end i want to stop hurting people thats matter to me and if that mean for me to be gone then I'll do whatever it takes. 

Oct,4,2021 life has sent me in a different path in which I think is the right one, I lost her and its for good. It never ended...  hurting the people I love never ended and its going to stick with me for the rest of my life, I try to find my own happiness within people I love put my own happiness will never be filled it only drains the happiness of the other person, they are always the best when they are with me but its never the best for me,I don't think I can truly make someone happy. I'm only here to build them and make them the best they can be and for me? It's always the same. I make myself think that I'm happy and that I'm okay but I'm really not, ive never been really okay 

Dec,7,2021 I've come to the conclusion that I'm really only here to help other people, I find someone that I think I love and build them as much as I can and make them the best person they can be and in the end I just stay the same nothing gained from it just more of my mentality is gone.

I recently lost my driving licence, had to find a new job closer or somewhere with accommodation. Anyways, I found a new job, with accommodation and they even gave me a big payrise. Was really happy at the time, but now I am living alone. Previously I was living with parents. 

Right now I am really struggling, only 2 weeks into my new job and living alone, my new job is okay but my boss stressed me out to the point where I am losing sleep over it. And previously I struggled with slight depression, where I'd have mood swings and feel sad a lot of the time for no real reason. Now I am really struggling. I feel like living alone has made a huge impact. Even when living at my parents I barely spoke to them, it's a strange relationship. But I think even knowing my family was there kept me sane and kept my mind at ease. 

I'm not sure why I feel so sad, I don't have suicidal thoughts but I keep thinking to my self that I can't be bothered living this day to day life. I feel so meaningless to society, it's so weird i can't explain. But I feel like every night i finish work and go to my flat, that everything I do is meaningless as I don't really go out and I don't have friends who live by my new work. I'm not sure what to do.   
This is the first time i have ever come out like this, and I am doing it on reddit to hear all your suggestions. I did recently look at counceling but it costs money and I am not sure that it is the right way to go.

I don't want to marry anything. I want to feel love to that person, but, girls who are cute, smart and lovely just don't want me!

Here we go again, my biannual whining session on this sub. I've been posting this shit since I was 16. Now I'm 24, I guess i have now proven that: no it doesn't get any fucking better. It gets worse and worse and worse and worse. But who am I to complain, me, a useless sack of shit, completely reprehensible pathetic leech. It shouldn't get any better, if you are so useless, so lazy, so cowardly, irresponsible, if you won't lift a fucking finger to change anything. I should suffer, hell, my ""suffering"" isn't half as bad as some people that do everything right and still suffer. in 8 years I haven't done shit to improve my situation. I just sat on my fat ass, ate food, watched movies. Then I tried to get a job, turn my life around, but guess what, turns out having a job is a lot harder than sitting on your ass and leeching off of your parents. I deserve every shitty thing that happened to me, I am the one who made my life into the worst possible timeline. I just won't change, I'm stuck, I'm all the way down. 
What should I do? Change is impossible, or it is possible but I'm just lazy, either way I'm never going to change. I'm just going to keep getting worse.
Doctors, meds? They are fucking useless.
Exercise, hobbies, relationships. Been there done that, and guess what, it doesn't fucking help. 

The only thing that can save me is getting a job, keeping a job, working to support myself. But I just won't fucking do it, so? I deserve to be miserable, I deserve to suffer because I choose to suffer and be miserable. But even getting a job is kind of pointless, they don't make your life better, they don't make you less miserable. But they are good for keeping your head above water, work grounds you in reality, it slows down psychological decay. The longer you stay idle The more fucked up you become, in all honesty, if I was forced to work from young age I think I would be better off now. I kind of blame my parents, first they destroy me mentally by neglect, alcoholism and drug use, but then they let me stay at home forever and soak in my own self pity, they let me hibernate for years. But blaming you parents for your shitty life at 24 years old is pathetic, I know. I'm the one responsible, they just enabled me to do what I wanted. Stay at home, never face the real world, hide in my room like a pathetic little child. And now I'm here,  24, no job, no education, not even a highschool diploma. I my behaviour keeps getting more erratic, I scream when I'm angry, I break shit, there's nothing left to break through. I keep getting dumber everyday, I was never the sharpest tool in the shed anyway, most people always saw me as dumb. Stupid, lazy and mentally ill, that's a fucking recipe for success right there. 
I'm just waiting for God to kill me now. I hope I'll die before this shit gets even worse, I've seen what it's like, and I don't want to live like that. If anybody read this incoherent rant, thank you for you time!

During puberty I have developed a condition known as “gynecomastia”… which is essentially man boobs. It was a very minor case, and it was actually barely noticed by most people. However I wanted to just be a normal boy with a flat chest. I opted for surgery to remove the excess breast gland I had growing inside my chest giving it a very feminine appearance. I know it may seem silly to want to bring yourself to suicide because of puffy nipples, but when I tell you that this condition has destroyed my confidence and has caused me sleepless nights and total loss of motivation to do anything, I’m not lying. The surgery supposedly “went well” and I would see the results within 6 months. 2 weeks go buy and they still look the same. I was told that because of the incisions, I had scar tissue, which is causing the feminine like appearance in my chest again. I was told to be patient and that it WILL subside. I think I was lied to. The scar tissue hasn’t gone down in the slightest, and it feels like not enough of what was there before was removed at all. What I’m left with 5 months later is those same insecurities, depressiveness, lack of motivation and just generally melancholy feelings that I had before, but magnified x10.

I have experienced anxiety all my life but it wasn't until I was in college that I realized what I was experiencing was anxiety. I started on Paroxetine 20mg in 2016 when I was 20 years old because I thought I had Marijuana dependencies but in reality it was very bad anxiety. I thought about suicide most days which then led me to looking for options.. My family Dr started me on Paroxetine 20MG and 0.5 Ativan for when needed. I was on this dosage up until 2021 where I started to wean off in April of this year. I was hit with a brick wall of crippling anxiety and depression which was the first time getting the crippling feeling (not want to move, crying all day, Sleeping to pass the time, not seeing an end to my mental health) since 2016. I went to my Family Dr and as well as a counselor and they both recommended to get back on my medication. Within 2 weeks I was starting to feel a difference, I was able to golf with friends and do just about anything I wanted to do. My anxiety was not holding me back and I was starting to live again.

Then the end of September 2021 I got hit heavy with the crippling anxiety and Depression. I took a week off work; even when I work from home because I could not concentrate. I got in contact with my Dr and started to see a Psychologist. They boosted my medication Paroxetine to 30mg and wanted to see if that would do it. I waited the 10 weeks out and I had good days and bad, most of the bad outweighed the good. I found myself less with anxiety but still having sever Depression. I am not suicidal but I don't find excitement in living... especially if my life is going to be tortured with these thoughts and feelings. I am not eating hardly at all, I want to sleep most of the day just to pass time. I'm really scared that this feeling is going to stay persistent in my life forever. My psychologist added 150MG Wellbutrin to my daily intake as well as the 30Mg paroxetine. I started this just yesterday 12/06/2021... I Have many people around me supporting me, especially my significant other who does everything she can to make me feel better. I am very in love and want to give her the world, I'm worried this mental health is going to eat at me my entire life. Nothing is scarier than not knowing.. If I can describe the feeling I am having all day then picture the happiest moment or day you ever had. The time you felt most alive, you were laughing and having the best moment of your life.. Now think about how you will never ever have that day again, if its a time when you were young.. You wont ever have those days again.. That feeling of your heart in the bottom of your stomach is exactly how I feel all day.

Can someone who has experienced this or even can relate in any way please tell me it does pass. I am so afraid and I wake up each morning with the feeling that there is so much time in the day.. I feel hopeless most of those minutes, I reach out to anyone I can just to hear them tell me it will be okay. Please tell me this passes.",depression,2021-12-08 01:45:17

I’ve been watching a lot of tv and YouTube videos, they somehow make me feel normal and let me laugh but something strange is happening, I’m beginning to not associate the people on tv as real humans. It’s like I feel I’m in a video game or a fake world. What even is a person, we act funny and weird looking. Bodies are weird and I’m starting to feel uncomfortable in my skin. I just don’t get it. I’m losing a sense of what it is to be human though when I am around people and I am forced to conserve I do have empathy and enjoy company but it’s been harder lately because ive been so depressed. I also recently changed my medication to Wellbutrin and a mood stabilizer. So might have to do with that and the weather sucking. Yesterday I just cried about everything, things that are sad, things I’m guilt of in the past, the fact I’m crying made me cry and then the fact I was so pathetic crying about all that made me cry more. I feel so sorry for myself in those moment I cried even more!! Maybe those were panic attacks but idk.

I recently resigned from a good company, well paid role because I didn't enjoy the work and am not passionate about the industry, management was also changing so there's a culture shift. I started hating waking up for work so looked for a new role, I thought I was stepping into a new role where I would enjoy and be able to grow but since starting with the new company, there's no team culture here, no one talks to each other, there's no work flexibility with WFH (which they promised me there would be when I interviewed). I've raised this with management and they said to wait until the new year and we will discuss to potentially allow 1 day a week at home.. 

I took a pay cut going into this role and now I'm really considering about resigning here too but that would mean I have no income. I have some savings that will probably get me by for the 2-3 months but I'm scared of not having an income. 

I also don't even know what I want to do, I tried looking for some other roles but when job searching I realise I don't have a clear career progression, I don't know what I want to do with my life.

As the tittle implies, it's more of a question towards those who have been depressed, who had suicidal thought, who had sleepless nights and saw no future for themselves. Yet somehow they got out of bed, made a breakfast and moved on. And managed to reach a stable point in their life, maybe not a happy one, but an ""Okay"" one. Where going to sleep isn't a wish you woudn't wake up, and waking up isn't just you realized there is no secret santa.

I've been depressed for as long as i can remember, was sucidal ( not so much now adays ) used to self harm, all that kinda crap that comes with it. But for 2 years of my life i was just numb, and i regret it more then anything because it feels like it took something from me, after i've gotten to feel things again.. there was only pain, lonely nights (weeks and months ) spent crying and just to much to bear. Recently my brain decided that feeling nothing is alot better then feeling miserable every day ( again ) and i don't want it to be that way, but i don't have the energy to move, to get out, to find a job, to find a lover, to build something. No dreams, No desires, No goals, No purpouse.

How does one find those again?

I'm sorry that it happened this way. 
Everyday if feel that I just go through life like a robot that is stuck in the middle of a routine. Everyday like became routine, routine,routine and it just never stopped. I never felt happy with myself.  I was never satisfied with what people consider as achievements. To me an achievement was just you being surprised that I didn't fuck up again. I became tired of it.  Relationships for the most part had always seemed one sided where I was always the one being picked on or talked about. I could never feel normal. The more I had to worry about the more anxiety got. The feeling that I would never be able to get my grades up, graduate, have a stable relationship, and I guess what people call live ""life"". 

Even though it had looked like I had gotten better, the suffering and the pain got worse. Even though I started to feel a little bit happier when I had lost a bit of weight. The body dismorphia had taken a toll on me where all I would feel is that I was in the same place when I was 200 pounds. Using the gym as a coping mechanism. Using the muscle that had built to cover the depression. The more fit I got the more I felt badly about myself. I used the gym as a crutch to cope with the trial of what we call life. 

People become obsessed on having of legacy for what they achieved in life and let it live on in their children as a reminder to society what their relatives had accomplished. What they want society to remember them as.

 In the end some people end up dying earlier than others. 

Anyone that I mention know that you were loved but couldn't have changed the outcome. 

 Mom and dad, grandma and grandpa, I'm sorry I know that you tried your best. 

Ashley, know that I loved you even though you didn't feel the same.  I hope that you find someone that you are satisfied with someone who treats you with the utmost respect, trust, and care. Know that I gave my all to you in the short time I knew you. I know you'll achieve great things in life.  And I forgive you for what you did to me. 

Sául, know that you were like the brother that I was never able to have. Thank you. The one that I knew that I could ask for help and advice when I couldn't go to anyone else. Even though we saved each other in ways no one would ever know about. You were my brother. Unfortunately, I think that my parents liked you a bit more than me. I hope that you finish the program at school. You'll achieve more than what I could ever have done. You'll become one of the best special ops pilots the United States department of defense will ever see. Know that the outcome of this couldn't have been changed. Semper Fi. 

Nico, you also helped me in ways I you didn't know about. 2020 was he'll and you helped me through it   

Genesis, You were a great friend to me know that you were loved. Know that you impacted me in ways that I didn't know could happen. I'm sorry if I ever made you feel uncomfortable. You'll go on to do great things and know that you deserve way better than Charles. If given the chance I would have taken a bullet for you.

Hopefully, we meet again.",depression,2021-12-08 10:59:41

586,rbjox9,Would it even be worth it to take a gap semester for my mental health if it means I might end up spending an extra year at home in an emotionally draining environment?,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rbjox9/would_it_even_be_worth_it_to_take_a_gap_semester/,1,"I'm in my first semester of community college and it's going pretty terrible, I thought I planned it out so that it'd go alright at least. Before the semester started I finally started getting professional help from a psychiatrist, got a diagnosis for my depression, and I started on antidepressants. I planned out my classes so I would be taking subjects that I do pretty well in and that I also found interesting. All of them were online too so on bad days I could still go to class without leaving my bed. I do think I took on more classes that I should've but I wanted to keep myself busy and thought it wouldn't be too overwhelming.

So I lasted maybe 3 weeks before I could barely find the energy to get work done and maybe 2 more weeks before I couldn't even get myself to log into my classes. I got myself to ask for help unlike other times though and emailed my professors to explain why I wasn't getting work done and ask them for some extensions to catch up. Fortunately they were all very understanding and were okay with me turning in some assignments late. Unfortunately nothing changed still I couldn't get myself out of bed or make myself do anything without quitting because I kept getting stressed out. Then maybe like a month ago I reached out to a counselor to talk and get some guidance on what I could do to try and get back on track. Talking with them helped I felt better, I took their advice and cut down on my course load to only 2 classes. But since I'm here writing this post I think you already realized that even now with only 2 classes, I stilled haven't gotten back to any schoolwork. I feel so stupid cause why can't I at least start, why am I just paralyzed in bed scared about even trying to start!

At this point I'm not even sure I should be surprised this happened. Prior to this the first time my depression got super bad was half way through my freshman year of high school, before that I think I was managing pretty well. Anyways my GPA tanked and I couldn't make it through a full week of school without leaving halfway through some days or not even going at all. And every time when I'd have to register for the next year's classes I'd tell myself ""I'll be able to handle it next year"" and sign up for a bunch of classes and take on a lot of honors/AP classes like my peers were doing. The same cycle would repeat again and again. But between summer and the start of the 2020'-2021' school year I had come to peace that I didn't have the grades to go to a 4-year college that I'd like, and there were was no turning that around in my last year of high school. So I decided community college was the best option for me, I'd save money and have a better chance of transferring to a 4-year I'd like this way. I still think it was the right choice for me, but the major downside of this was that I'm stuck at home for an extra 2 years before I can transfer (3 years possibly if I take the gap semester).

I feel like I rambled too much, but anyways I'm considering taking next semester off to try an give myself a break to recharge and get myself to a point where I'm not burnt out at the slightest inconvenience. I want to spend the first month or so focusing on ""stabilizing myself"" if that makes sense; push myself to start looking for and going to a therapist, make an effort to fix my sleep schedule, start exercising (regularly if I can get myself to), and make time for my hobbies and get back to enjoying them. I also wanna get my drivers license so I have a bit more freedom (I've been putting it off because I keep getting irrationally worried my suicidal thoughts will get really bad again and I'll end up making myself crash or something, for reference I've ever only had thoughts but have never acted on them). But after that first month or so I want to maybe look at getting a part-time job and try to take some time to self study before going back to school in the summer. 

There's a few things that have me on the fence about taking time off though. For one thing I'm worried I'll end up making my depression worst, I could just end up lying in bed the whole time locked away in my room. The one thing that kind of eases my worry about that happening is starting therapy, I feel like that extra support/resource might stop me from falling back into a self destructive routine or I'll at least have someone to hold me accountable and help me get through it. Second is that I'll basically be a year behind, I already know I'm going to have to retake my classes from the current semester. Which means I'd graduate later then the rest of my friends, I know I shouldn't care about this and it won't matter in the grand scheme of things but I just can't get myself to stop thinking about it. It also means I'd be spending more time at home. I don't really know how to describe my living environment with my family, but I know it's not really healthy. I'm not in any physical danger, but I'm constantly anxious and disappointed with myself. I feel like I have to constantly walk on eggshells to avoid getting yelled at and have my self esteem torn down. I don't want to say it's always like this but it's like when things are calm now I don't trust it cause I know it can switch at any moment. I think I can last another 3 years here but I don't know if I want to, I really want to transfer and move out and be on my own as soon as I can without worrying about my financial situation too much. 

So there's my dilemma should I take the time off and try to improve my mental health and accept that I might be at home for a bit longer? Or should I try to push through and take classes next semester so I can transfer when I originally planned to? 

There's also the option of starting with a lighter course load next semester but seeing how this semester went for me I don't know if that would be any different then taking a normal course load.",depression,2021-12-08 10:56:02

I can physically feel the pain in chest and head and its too much. I just want to scream and bang my fucking head on the wall but i cant. Im stuck in this forever loop of pain and torment, with no ability to feel anything else and it takes alot of effort to fucking cry. This is my hell. I want out. I fucking want out. Im done. IDK what to do anymore. Things are not getting better, theyre becoming worse and worse everyday. I hope i get a heart attack soon or some painless quick death that atleast makes my parents feel better than me suiciding. I fucking hope i get covid and die from it, yes that seems like a plan. I have no future, i just dont. Theres no point keep going on this endless loop. God if youre real please show me mercy and end my suffering i beg of you",depression,2021-12-08 10:44:40

However, okay almost never means good. i’m just…here. i get the groceries, i bring and drop off my siblings at school, i go to school myself, i help do house chores, i run errands for my parent, i take the kids to their school events, i do it all…and somehow i’m the ungrateful child. okay. sure.

i’m pretty burnt out. lately, i’ve just been out of it. real suicidal as of late. but i can’t die, because who will defend my siblings from my mom? there’s a reason why my older sibling prefers being in the navy rather than being home. i don’t blame them. home can be difficult when you have a parent who loses it when you p o l i t e l y disagree with them and then somehow makes you the villain. i wish i offed myself when i had the chance, but i’m kind of stuck here now. i hate it.

anyways, back to sunsets and snow… i don’t like the cold and i’m too busy running around (or sleeping) to notice the sunset. nowadays, once the clock hits 5 p.m it’s automatically nighttime. but it’s nice to watch the kids enjoy the cold weather. i guess there can be some positives in the little things. too tired to bother noticing, i guess. crazy.",depression,2021-12-08 10:44:19

I wouldn’t call myself depressed, but as the days go on I notice how I’m not really living my life..Like, I’m obviously alive, but I just go through the motions and do things in life because I feel like I have to in order to be considered normal. I go to school and work (constantly!) and rarely have breaks. 
   However, when it’s really quiet and I’m all alone, there is no one around me, there is a pain that runs through my chest. It gets harder to breath, the thoughts are darker, and I become completely self aware of my misery and self hatred. If you were to catch me at uni or at work, I would never come across as someone that is depressed. However, when I’m alone, laying in my bed, I become aware of how alone I feel. I become aware of the stillness of the room, the emotions rushing through my head, and my overall unhappiness.

My schooling is hell. I have a test tommorow and Thursday, as well as two projects due Friday, and am helping host a ""Shark Tank Junior"" competition for my DECA project, which involves managing over forty 10 year olds for an hour and a half, Thursday morning, which will potentially take away all of my test time. 

Athletics is every day after school and on Saturdays, and since I always stay late, putting in extra work, as our track team is extremely competitive, so I stay the number 1 distance runner in our conference. 

I recently had an extremely traumatic break-up, and have always felt intense loneliness. I've been searching for that companionship again, incessantly, which has just lead to me getting more and more emotionally damaged as relationships fall apart again and again. I'm desperately lonely and extremely depressed as is, and the stress of all this is killing me.

I don't fucking understand how I'm supposed to do all this schoolwork and athletics while maintaining my mental state as is, let alone deal with my EDD along with it. The stress is killing me and I want to blow my brains out. 

Everyone around me has just told me that there's nothing I can do, and none of my teachers are going to make concessions for me just because I'm unreasonably stressed, because that's ""part of life"" (even though I bet my life is 5x as stressful as any of theirs)

607,rb9l0e,🎵🎶🎵,3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rb9l0e/_/,0,"I was listening to Tori Amos’s song Happy Phantom recently, and was struck by the realization that its lyrics take me back to the feeling of being in third grade. I have distinct memories of taking long “bathroom breaks” in third grade to wander around my school’s hallways, daydreaming about being a ghost, and plotting to commit suicide in various ways to achieve that end. I thought that being a ghost sounded wonderful. Imagine retaining your own consciousness BUT being entirely “off the grid.” Invisible. Free of all obligations. Allowed to cry and wail and clank your chains as much as you wanted without being told to stop “being a baby.”

How old is a third-grader? Like seven? 

These are the first suicidal thoughts that I remember having. They haven’t stopped nearly two decades later, although I’ve only ever made one serious attempt at killing myself.

I remember reading somewhere that “only” 30% of Americans report being completely happy in life. I can’t imagine how the number isn’t lower than 30%. I hate that I feel this way because I truly do WANT everyone to be happy, but honestly sometimes happy people make me furious. Like... I myself am a lucky person with a warm apartment, health insurance, and food in the fridge, but I can walk two blocks in any direction and see five people who DON’T have those privileges. Knowing that I’m lucky is different than feeling happy about it. Happiness would necessarily entail the basic needs of those around me being met in addition to my own. I do what I can, obviously, but handing someone five bucks here and there doesn’t fulfill me. Plus, unfortunately, the deeper you get involved, sometimes, the more heartbreak you see. I spend a lot of my free time w projects like food not bombs and sometimes I feel like I’m just standing around and watching people on the street getting crushed, then mangled, then killed by the world.

Anyway. This was supposed to be about fucking tori Amos lyrics lmao

I just don’t get it, is what I’m saying. I’ve been depressed my whole life and I can’t imagine not being this way. I’ve put a lot of time, energy, money, blood, sweat, tears, etc into recovery over the past five years or so, but honestly I’m about to throw in the fucking towel and commit to just being a bitter, misanthropic old bitch who drinks at work and says shit like, “What does it look like?!” when asked how his day’s been going lmfao

My friend got diagnosed with depression few months ago, about when school started. It is also important to mention that we've been friends for a few years.

Anyway I was struggling with depression myself for nearly two years. Everyday was like hell and my friend wasn't really there for me as I was expected him to. After I got out of massive depressive episode he got the diagnosis and I have always been there for him since. I share my food, my money even my personal stuff with him, anything that can help him, but he makes me feel like my help is just useless to him. 
Sometimes I wish he would return even a little bit of the stuff I do for him. He just ""takes"" from me. But when I consider doing it back at him he feels uncomfortable. Like the time he bought some potato chips and sat beside me to eat them as I was having a conversation with him ,I took a chip and I just knew by his face that he didn't like what I did so I didn't take any more. I feel so selfish just by thinking that just because I share my food with him he would do the same. 

Everyday with him is just the same. Im trying to be helpful, I do anything that takes to make him feel comfortable, I do all the talking because he doesnt even do that with me. 
Im so tired of starting the conversations and having to keep them going by myself, he would never have a descent conversation with me, he would just react to the things I say or respond with a single word. Just like when was telling him about something excited that happened to me and he didn't even bother to care about it. He is so emotionless all the times its so draining. I feel like he's bringing me down with him. It's just too much negativity. Im tired of his negativity. At this point he's just affecting my life too but I can't tell him that because he tried to commit the other week again. Im so tired of being worried if he's going to do it again, I feel like my help is never enough and i just feel more and more guilty, almost as if Im responsible for his happiness because im basically his only friend, if not the only one then one of them. 

He is getting proper care for his illness but I think Im not the kind of person that can help someone for too long. At this point I just put his needs first ahead of mine, I don't talk about my problems or anything negative with him so he wouldn't feel worse than he is. I just don't feel like he is being a friend to me, I feel like im his therapist. I don't know what to do anymore Im still struggling with mental health which makes it even harder for me.

Im tired of all of this",depression,2021-12-08 02:02:42

I just feel empty inside. It's not everyday but, once every 3 weeks or so it hits me really hard for a few days and I have to really work to get back on track.

There’s a world without borders somewhere in my mind that doesn’t reflect in my waking life. This feeling has made it even less bearable to wake up. My body feels like a weight over my mind and soul. The lack of freedom in this world has sunk in to a point where I have accepted the day to day life as just part of my living penance for some sin i must’ve committed in the past life. I take what little happiness I can get just so I can make it through the day and fall back into my wonderland. 

People tell me dreams can be made real and all I need is to put the effort in to bring them out. But where in this shared reality can I levitate off the ground? Manifest a cosmic pen where I can draw something in to existence. A place where adventure matters more than money, status, and social media followings.

However, I ran out and don’t have the money to buy the refill. I will get new insurance on January 1 that will make my prescription free. So, I’m trying to make my reserves last until then.

I have some 150mg tablets that are from maybe a year ago or so. I’ve been cutting off the edges to try to make the pill into 100 mg. Then, I’ve also been taking 2 edges together to equal 100 mg. Ever since I started doing this, I have been feeling awful. My depression and anxiety surged a lot. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m not cutting the pills accurately, or if it’s because the pills are older and don’t work as good. There’s also a chance that the pills aren’t affecting it at all and that it’s just a coincidence that I’m feeling worse.

In a couple days, I’m going to switch to my 150 mg XL tablets that are supposed to be once a day. I’m not going to cut them, I’m just going to take them once a day.

it's disgusting even to admit, but the ""r word"" is the most common occuring fantasy... im still young. when i was ten i was in a sexual relationship with a ninteen year old guy online. when i tried to break it off he told me that of course i didnt love him, there was someone else better than him, that he should just kill himself, just trying to get me to stay. he sent me a d\*\*k pic once (i didnt ask for it) and he talked so much about us meeting and doing ""it.""

i think about it so much but i know im not the victim. i was the one who searched for someone to talk to about sexual things and i told him i was sixteen. i know it was all my fault but i just want someone to tell me that it wasnt. i know it sounds fucking horrible. i know im a terrible person. i just want someone to notice that something is wrong. i dont even care if they abandon me. i know i deserve it. at least i have the comfort of knowing what people think.

so i want something undeniably bad to happen to me. i want to KNOW that i am the victim. because right now im not. i didnt know what i was getting myself into and i would do anything to go back. but right now i can only hope that something bad happens to me or i gain the courage to talk to someone. i just need someone to pay attention.

of course i think about other things happening to me. but this is the most common. it makes me feel so shitty and i just want to kill myself. there are so many contributing factors to my inner shitfuck of a mind, but this one is one of the biggest. and all i can do to deal with it is just not think about it.

My mind is an ocean, and I am drowning in thoughts, the stress of being a teenager is more than I bargained for, my life is just one story but there are many different plots, my mother wants me to be forever pure, but the deed is already done. It was not up to her; it was my opinion. The stress of finding oneself is more brutal than not.

“You should be happy all the time!” My dad says. 
“You are in your prime,” 
Well, I'm sorry dad that you do not detect, that I am too stressed to think of another rhyme. 
Sometimes I wonder. How did we go from this to that? From children to adults, from sharpie hearts to tattoos, from holding hands to having sex, from wearing tank tops to having long sleeves 24/7. I can't remember my first time reading my first word, or the first time I had a temper tantrum, but I do remember my first kiss, my first-time attempting suicide... we remember what we feel is important; what our brain deems a worthy memory... often it is the things we think nothing of, pay no attention to when we are kids, now when you try not to pay any attention, it bites you in the ass. 
“you're an adult now,” they say.
“I expect you to act like one,”

I have a job which pays alright, I have family and a couple of close friends which I love more than anything else. At one point in life I was even succesful in sports and some people probably even looked up to me in some way. That's what it seems like from the outside looking in.

In realiy, I hate my job. I'm just so so tired. Tired of everything. I have no energy nor motivation to do the simplest tasks, i.e cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and such. I just get up, eat and watch movies until I can go back to sleep again. The only time I ever get out of my apartment is when going to work, which I have to do in order to stay afloat.

My biggest fear in life is burdening other people. This goes to such extremities so for example, the heating in my apartment doesn't work. But I'm too tired and anxious to even call my landlord to have it fixed, because I don't want to bother others with my issues. So I'm sitting here in my 15C(59F) cold ass apartment, wrapped with multiple blankets typing this. When relatives and my few friends check in on me on messenger and such I just ignore them, because I can't muster the energy to think of an answer. Thanks to this fear I find it impossible to open up to people, so I just avoid socializing and can't tell anyone about my issues either.

I quit the sport I was doing as well because of my incredible lack of energy and motivation. To top it all off, I live in a cold ass country and it's currently -20C(-4F) all day, and the sun is up for about an hour a day at most. My only joy in life right now is getting absolutely shitface drunk on the weekends so that I can forget about my feelings, if only just for a brief moment.

Will things ever get better, or is this all life is supposed to be? Because if it is, I'm not so sure it's worth living to be completely honest",depression,2021-12-08 01:35:23

I’m about to lose my job, I just got rejected from another company, got divorced a few months back and now I’m totally alone. My ex-wife has taken my family. She painted herself as the victim to them. My girlfriend is great, but she suffers from depression also. Our relationship is full of love and turmoil. It’s exhausting. 

I’ve tried to get help. I swear I have. But with Covid, doctors are either booked out months or just not taking on patients. I cannot get the help I need because I don’t have “good insurance”. The cards are stacked against me. 

Self harm - A lot of people reading this will relate. I do not have the ability to take my life. But I think about it more than I should. I know the schtick, “You have so much to live for!”, “It’s a permanent solution…”, “How would XXXX feel if you weren’t around?” Here’s the thing…I’ve reached out to these people who care, and it’s all platitudes. It’s bullshit they feel they need to say. So I can’t think of a reason not to, but I would never be able to.

Yesterday I had a rough bout and I started going down a line of thinking and emotions that I wouldn't want anyone to go down. Rn I'm (20m) in college and while I'm doing ok in my classes my social life has been really bad and I haven't made any friends or talked to girls or anything and it really brings me down a lot of days when I basically just spend my whole days alone. It's also not like I can just not think about these things, these are basic human desires imo and everytime I sit alone to eat I'm reminded of how alone I am and that my days are passing by, and I just look at all the people sitting together. The fact I'm still alone just reinforces my thoughts that I'm ugly, not valuable and that I am almost fated to be alone. It's worse when I enter another depressive period because all my negative self thoughts are objectively kinda true. I don't have friends, nobody in my college really cares about me, I don't have a girlfriend or much less any friends that are girls or anything. It's not like I can just say, ""Ok, maybe I'm being a bit hard on myself"" because it's just true. I know my reasons for being down are objectively not as bad as other people have it (actual traumas like death of a loved one, abuse etc), but these are just things I've struggled with my whole life and I just wish I could know that things would change someday and that I would find that group and that I will find that girl, but I feel cursed and like I won't get out of my life what I want anymore so it's like, what's the point. Also, I sometimes just self sabotage myself and kinda put on a meanish demeanor I guess just to keep people away for some reason and the one time I did get invited somewhere it just felt meaningless and like there's better people out there than me to go out and do stuff.

I am seriously burn out and tired as hell but can’t rest as I have to study for finals in order to get a good grade. 

As you guys definitely know, when shit happens , they come in a row.

My secondary school or you may consider as high schoolmate are hosting an activity and they didn’t invite , tag  nor mention me at all in the group chat. Feeling completely excluded as always.

sometimes when I go out with them, no one cares about me or how I am dressed how much I prepared, just no one notices.

I can’t find anyone to comfort me
No friends or anyone trustworthy enough to take my neutron-star heavy mental burden. I afraid they would leave , consider me weird and others. I had a teacher that understood my trouble and mental difficulties I set for myself.

I cant even find any good mate in college either.

I am also finding it difficult to trust in hard work.
 I had attended something similar to A level exam in England and worked a year and a half for it . However, the result are shit to me but no one can understand me as they all thought the grade was ‘good enough’. People who worked later easily got a better score. There's a saying called 'Tried best so no regret' in my country and when people yelled , I just cant. And with this experience, I am seriously afraid this happening again and fail my exams.

I am studying hard but I dont trust myself.
 Not to mention I get joked at that I study very hard while my schoolmate is having fun and participating in every activity and studying even harder than people trying to retake the fore-mentioned A level similar exam. When someone cant join the activity, people in the group chat felt sorry for him but no one cared about me.

Studying in this college is the only way possible for me as I am certain I am a piece of trash that arent special at all but the more I spend time on it the more I felt like shit. I will never be good or close to people studying this course and the course I am having rn is the most easy already.

I dont even know what to do, I dont even want to eat chocolate or do anything and if I dont do anything I stress out over my inactivity on studying for finals

I feel like my depression is like not enough or something. like if I actually get diagnosed depression at least I might get some attention or prescription drugs to treat it. I know it maybe offensive but thats how ignored I am, no one cares about me.

I know I am not gonna kill myself. My family will be sad and I dont wanna be more of a burden to them. I doubt any of my 'friends' would care tho. Moreover, there are bullies that are complete human waste and scumbag even alive. but I am barely functional at all and broken.

Normally I would not consider myself a ""depressed"" person, but my circumstances have shown me that anything can happen to anyone. I am going to give you an understanding of who I am. 

I do not have friends, i never have had many friends. I was raised by my parents, my father was abusive and my mother although she tried her best, neglected me for the most part and still does without really realizing it, i do not hold resentment towards my parents only a bit of disappointment and sadness that I was so unfortunate in so many aspects of my life. I was homeschooled for the first few years of my life as my father is a very religious man from the middle east, Islam is his life yes he is an extremist. My mother shared his views for a short period of time when they had first gotten married, but as I grew up I saw her heavily stray from religion and this is where the problems began. My sisters and I lied to my father about many things, it is complicated to get into but yes we were raised to believe lying was ok, how could we know any better? If your mother lies so well to someone you are supposed to be truthful to (my father) why would I feel a need to tell the truth when lying protected me from consequence and hardship? Of course I could not realize that my actions have consequences until I became much older. My mother taught me horrible lessons, and I did not have a father figure as I only saw my dad for about an hour a day, and when I did it was a very negative experience that left me with some trauma and other mental illnesses that I have been trying to deal with. 

I was homeschooled until I was about 7, I had absolutely no contact with anyone outside of my family. I could talk to my neighbors from behind a fence, but to go to another persons house, it was not allowed. I was tethered to such a toxic household for so long, and my social skills were, and still are stunted because of this. When I was 8, my mother had gotten farther from her religion and my father, she decided it would be okay to enroll me in public school. I was bullied for being a weirdo. I had no understanding of anything outside of my house, I did not know what was socially acceptable, I did what came naturally to me. I treated people the way that I treated my family members. I did not realize at the time I was being bullied. I wore shoes with buckles on them, people asked where I got my clothes and I told them my mom had gotten them for me at a yard sale or flea market proudly. 

As the years went by I began to understand what was happening, people did not like me. I looked different, I behaved different, people are afraid of what is different and I am guilty of feeling this way too. I became bitter, I didn't understand why people didn't like me and I began to hang around other kids who were like me. I was 15 when I had first gotten ""depressed"". My mother used to tell us that if we were sad it was because we were ungrateful for what she had been given to us, and my father was someone who i feared at the time. I had a group of very negative piers that I hung around at school. I remember they started talking about smoking weed, everyone made it sound like a very nice experience. I actually bought a gram of weed but i didn't know how to smoke it so i made an apple bong and just lit the bud on fire with a lighter, lol. One of the people i hung around eventually mentioned that he had begun selling pills to help pay for his dad in jail (?) and this is when a new problem began 

I had a job with my mother as a janitor, I made about 30 dollars a week from this job. I began to use this money to buy pills from what I thought at the time was my friend, but this was one of the worst mistakes that I made when i was younger that i still regret so much even now. I would take pills in class, what started as one turned to two, you know the story, I became an addict. I got to the point where I had to be taken out of school because I was having ""chemically induced seizures"" I think. I would throw up on myself sometimes, in the bathrooms, and fall asleep in class because that is what these pills did to me, I had no idea what I was taking at the time. I was taken out of school and isolated from society for another 2 years until i was about 18 doing nothing in this time but play video games and get even more sick in the head. 

While in isolation, I had completely forgotten how to talk to people on top of the fact that I already had very lackluster communication skills and a lot of social anxiety. My dad told me I needed to get a job, so i got one. I overcame my anxiety and began working a very physically demanding job but it was good for me, it gave me experience with people and gave me an understanding of what having a job was like. I have grown to value this experience I feel that it was very good for me. I met a guy there who taught me a lot of things, how to be nice to others, why we are nice to others, how to take care of my body and what the effects of having a good diet are etc. He was very patient with me and taught me everything he knew about socializing and society as a whole. This guy was the kind of guy everyone liked, very loud charismatic and lively, the fun sweet person that everyone wants to be. 

Eventually we had to part ways, we do not talk like we used to and he has grown disinterested in me and I have grown disinterested in myself. I have no friends now, I have been very nice to people treating them with respect and kindness but my brains interpretation of reality has become so cynical and hate filled. I know that life is not all misery, but i cannot see that right now and it hurts me so much. I want to be happy like how i was when i was with my best friend at my old job. I want to be happy i want people to like me and i want to like other people. I want to feel genuine emotion like i had felt in the past. I hate who i am now. I try not to do any negative things in my life and i feel that it is not paying off. I eat well i exercise i shower i brush my teeth which are all things i used to never do and to you may seem very easy and normal because you have done these things your whole life. I was never taught that these things were important. I cannot find the strength to love another person right now, i cannot find the strength to love myself. I have practiced mindfulness and taken a deep dive into successor philosophies but in my opinion these philosophies cannot work forever it becomes difficult at times and begins to feel useless like a waste of time. 

There is no point in being happy or being depressed, life is a waste of time. Everything is perspective, perspective changes anyone can think and say anything to become anything that they want, I know this. What is the point in doing anything? Why do we have goals? What am I hoping to gain in posting this? 

I am numb inside with very horrible thoughts inside of my head. I have been to psych wards, they are horrible places for mentally ill people and I will never go back. I feel my patience running thin and my negative desires becoming more intense.

I just need to say how empty I feel to anyone who might listen. I'm a married father, with a lot to be thankful for, but most of my waking life is spent somewhere between feeling depressed and abject misery.
I made a terrible career decision in the midst of a bad depressive episode in a misguided effort to stop myself feeling so terrible and actively contemplating suicide, and many years later have come to realise that my actions have ruined any chance I have of happiness. I've ended up in a career that I'm no good at and I very much dislike, which only appears to hold a lifetime of stress and low wages for the effort it involves, and my past career history does not lend itself to moving into a different path (I'm currently a specialised professional in the British public sector). I spend my days seeing my contemporaries who made better choices living a life I thought I was going to have, and feeling despair at how trapped I feel. 
Ive lost any confidence I ever had, and having 2 kids and a wife who's job would not be enough to secure a decent future for any of us alone makes me feel that making a radical change like retraining is impossible due to the likely debt I woul incur, and my own ability to succeed at anything else. I feel like I'm too old to have a reasonable career if I start again (38), and I seem to lack the ability to find ways of getting into other work. 
I vasilate between panicking about my current situation, hitting the depths when contemplating a miserable future, helplessly seeking a way out, and becoming furious at myself for my disastrous choices.
I feel like I've let down everyone in my life, and am going to let down my kids because I can't give them what they need to have a better life than me financially or in social capital. 
All I want to do is sleep. I think about quitting and trying to get a low stress, low responsibility job that I can't mess up, but even that seems beyond me and would only make my kids futures worse 
I've been told I'm depressed, but to me that is just a description of my reaction to a ruined life; I've tried medication, therapy and other beneficial activities, but as the underlying problems are there, I can't see how they can help. I've asked my family, my wife and the few friends I have if they can help me think my way out of my situation, but no one can help me and after all this time I think I've burned out their desire to try. And I realise it's not their responsibility to help me. I've had professional careers counseling, but I found it unhelpful as it seems aimed at people who gave the capability of being able to make good decisions - I am useless and bereft of ideas.
I often wish I would die; I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, but I think a lot about dying in accidents or of illness. I don't enjoy life anymore and the future looks terrible.
I just want to cry, and to be taken care of, which is pathetic. My younger self would not recognise what I've become and I'm ashamed.

I have nothing I enjoy.  
Nothing about this has any indication of changing regardless of how much work I put in.  


I don't understand how I can be expected to keep going.  


Everyday hurts so much. I cry sometimes.  
I fantasized about cutting myself and having my dog lick me better, so I can feel like someone is taking care of me. But I could never do that to him.  


I still want to cut myself. I want to practice tying nooses. I want to tie a noose around my neck and pull up so I can remember how it feels again.  


I'm so scared of myself. I'm so hard to handle.  
I have no one I can talk to. I have no one who can care for me.  
I want to be hugged by someone who's not going to leave. I want to tell someone what I'm thinking or how I feel without being thrown into the hospital.  


People are so terrifying. I can't rely on my self. People keep hurting me.  


I wish me and my brother had never been born.",depression,2021-12-08 06:45:38

The past couple of years I've been buying and buying stuff, but I always returned the items. Mostly because it never fits, but also because I'm raised with the idea to 'not think much of yourself'.

I'm wearing coats of 14+ years old. I have one acceptable shirt and about three other shirts that make me look ill. I have one pair of jeans that fits well but looks like I'm a teenager.

In my closet I have a pair of beautiful shoes that I'm not wearing because I'm afraid of my parents reaction and jealousy.

This probably sound stupid to a lot of you, but I just didn't have the privilege to have supportive and genuine caring/loving parents.

How do you do this? How do you order/buy clothes and wear them?

Man, this is awful.

I feel like I have to give someone else $1000 in order to spend this on myself.

The majority of my money goes to gifts to others. I have a difficult time on spending money on myself.

I’m worried about my 16 year old brother, basically he’s quiet, doesn’t speak unless spoken to, he only comes down for dinner, as soon as he finishes he’s straight back up to his room, if it’s not bathroom breaks or dinner, that’s where he is. He always has headphones in listening to music, he tells me he fantasises about him in alternate reality’s, and for the last 5 years he’s Raw dogged anxiety, no therapy, no meds. And I’m just worried on where this will lead him, he seems to love murder docs, in every film he always sympathises with the villains and says he’s “like them” he’s obsessed with the dark side of Star Wars, and when he does speak, it’s usually one word answers. I’m just worried. I don’t know what to say or do. he always has blank expressions, never really shows emotion, even when bad news hits him he just doesn’t react, at all. And when questioned he says he doesn’t wanna talk about negative stuff, also… he always says he’s “just tired” he hardly sleeps I know that for a fact, he owns a lot of columbine shooting books too, and I’m just really scared of who he is.

toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash

body soap, deodorant and hand-soap

cleaning stuff (he asked for this) Clorox cleaner. Garbage bags (black and kitchen) comet, disinfectant wipes

Aspirin (this he asked for as well)

3 canned soaps, peanut butter & jelly, bread

crackers, pretzels, Mac and cheese (microwave kind)

Some breakfast bars, whole grain snacks (banana nut) 

Ramen noodles (6 pack chicken and beef)

Hot pockets (his request) actually his only food suggestion. He says microwave is working

Chicken pot pies (frozen) Im worried about this one  
Gatorade 

the landlord said something was wrong with fridge right now, so suggested not a lot of perishable foods.   


landlord has scheduled a Cleaning crew for tomorrow. Apparently the apartment is really bad and landlord is worried about entire structure of the house. Ie pests, mold, etc. 

We are on east coast and Family is on west coast, we just got in contact with them yesterday as well. My husband is bringing goods now to his house to see where we go from here.

I just don’t have the energy anymore. It just feels like there’s such a heavy weight on my soul and I don’t know how to lift it. 

It’s been hard for so long and keeps getting harder. I used to enjoy life and be a happy kid, now I’m so far from that , that’s what depresses me the most.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with my life, i have a great family and good friends but for the last 5/6 years i’ve really been struggling and since starting uni this has got much worse. 

So basically this is what i’ve been feeling like:

- depressive thoughts spiral when i’m alone/ feel low all the time but sometimes there are several days it’s worse, feel empty and hopeless, no motivation 
- feel tired all the time, even more tired when i have to put up a facade of feeing good 
- random  feeling of anxiety, tight chest and heart sometimes pounding, can’t stop picking at head, can’t stay still, wake up feeling anxious for no reason. sometimes feel sick especially before having to go to social situations
- sometimes stress seems to induce headache/ migraines
- Don’t remember things/ people keep bringing up how bad my memory is, i remember nothing long term, and sometimes forget lots of things from recent days 
- can’t focus, head feels foggy

I just took it to heart probably too much and ended up crying, and she got upset because she feels like she can never do or say anything right and that I always get upset. She was eventually like “I can’t do this anymore it’s too much I don’t know how to support you” and it really hurt even though I understand her perspective. I’ve told her many times that she should just leave me if I’m too much but she swears she wants to be with me.

My best friend reached out to me in hopes of getting ""help"" from me and using my coping mechanisms to help herself. I gave her some options but pushed her to see a doctor/ get medication if it's really bad for her. I take medication and it got me to a place where I can function.

I’m constantly used as the family’s therapist and I feel all consuming guilt when I don’t listen to them and try to give them advice. 

I’m very empathic and I love to help people but the constant strain of being a therapist to my parents declining marriage, sisters problems, and all the mental health issues exhausts me and makes my mental health worse. I could go on and on about how bad it is but it’s too much to handle on hood day and I’m having an awful one. The stress of having to be there for every problem, every text, every phone call is way too much but I know if I don’t answer they will end up harming themselves or others. 

Today, my (18F) sister who has the worst depression of the family called me multiple times about her failing her classes this semester and what to do. This has been an ongoing problem that she almost daily calls and texts me about sobbing and telling me she doesn’t want to be alive. I’ve given her advice, told her what to do, comforted her, written emails for her, but she doesn’t take anything I give her and calls me worthless for not helping her. Today it was really bad, she only has a week left and she’s almost for sure going to fail her classes. The college she goes to is the one I went to 2 years ago and I had the same problems due to hospitalization for suicide attempt and ideation. I sent her all the resources, told her what to tell them and who to contact, but because I didn’t do it for her she hung up on me each call, only to call back and son to me about what to do. She talked about killing herself again and hung up, not answering my calls after. 

30 minutes later she called me sobbing that she got stuck in a ditch on her way to work. I live 5 hours away rn for college but I talked her through it and called everyone I knew there to help. She went on another tangent about not wanting to be alive and I tried to talk to her about therapy and the hospital again but she shut me down and hung up. 

What do I even do? If I stop answering her she’ll kill herself but she doesn’t want anyone’s help, she hates the world. 

TL;DR: My sister sobs to me daily about wanting to die but ignores all of my/anyone’s help and calls me worthless for not being able to fix her problems. Answering her greatly hurts my mental health and illnesses but if I don’t answer she’ll kill herself right away. She asks for help but doesn’t want it.

My understanding is that due to the low angle of the sun, your body will not be able to produce Vitamin D which is deficient in many during winter months. This deficiency of Vit D is the cause for S.A.D. Since the sun is not at an angle high enough >40degrees above the horizon to let the UVB rays reach the skin, your body is incapable of producing vit D. 

Why do people recommend it still? Its interesting because since I believe S.A.D is a result of vitD, I've tried VitD supplements at 10,000 IU doses and I do not feel any better; which proves my hypothesis incorrect to an extent.",depression,2021-12-08 04:25:43

My limbs are heavy, and I'm exhausted, on the last bits of energy a human body can exhort. So it's really more like a slow, painful plodding. Every step sends agony to my spine, and it's all I can do to not fall on my face and have to resort to crawling. There's someone behind me, a malevolent entity that is slowly making his way towards me, just as methodically as I am trying to escape. The only thing I know about this person is he *will* kill me if he catches up to me. 

I'm still moving, hauling my sore and battered body along, but I don't know why. Each movement is agony, and resting sounds so nice right now. Even though I know resting means doom, I want to curl up and let my limbs recover. I want to not feel so heavy. But I know I can't. Something deep inside me is urging me on and I have no choice but to allow it to pull me forward. It's going to pull and push me until I am stripped away. Nothingness, a skeleton still limping along, trying to escape.

 I will spend my whole life running from this man. He will be forever in my mind, he will never go away. My life has been built upon running from him for so long that its all I can do. I know nothing else but pressing onward, hoping to outrun him, but knowing I never will. I feel like my life is running and nothing else.

I wake up to the same alone routine, I absolutely hate it. It’s hard to get out of bed. Only time I am at peace is when I’m asleep. I have a few immediate family members but sometimes even they don’t want me around or we get into arguments. I do have a few friends, but I only ever talk to them via messaging, we never meet up.

One friend lives on the other side of the world, but when I talk to him about my problems, he eventually ends up getting really annoyed with me, and doesn’t seem hugely supportive. Yet he will tell me about his own problems from time to time, and expect sympathy, and expects me to help correct his English.

I don’t even have any employment thanks to this pandemic either, so I can’t meet anyone that way. I’m a 28 year old loser thanks to all this. I was supposed to take up a job offer abroad, I was so excited about it. But now it’s not happening thanks to Covid. So I’m stuck in a house share which I absolutely hate with 3 other people who I don’t even talk to because they keep to themselves. Can’t afford to get my own flat either because I have very little money. This virus has ruined practically everything. I can’t see my work situation or life ever changing now. It just goes on and on, with no end in sight. Even the manager from this job who still has theirs, as they were already over there doing the job for ages before Covid started, messaged me to find out how my life is going, to be nosy basically. The only way to escape all this is to die, I know that sounds bad. No pills the doctor can give me could make me feel better either.

No idea what to do anymore. I don’t want to seem like I feel sorry for myself, but getting out from this black cloud is much harder than some may realise. I get told other people out there have it way worse than me, which is true, but being told this still doesn’t stop me from feeling the way I do.

If anyone has any suggestions about how I can rebuild my messed up life, then they are very much welcome. I just don’t want to become any more bitter than how I currently feel.",depression,2021-12-07 16:59:20

I always try to be available for those people and to help them no matter what, because I want to show them how much they mean to me, yet if they don't need me, I dont exist. 

Today I felt like the 3rd wheel again and I just couldnt put on a smile and act like I dont mind. No laughs, no comments. I wanted to cry, but I think my face expressions were emotionless.

we all had a big group of friends. luci, my ""bestfriend"", recently got into a toxic relationship with someone whos sexually assaulted her (ive tried so hard to make her leave but she cant help herself so i cant do shit about it). people in the friend group noticed she began to change, she wasnt hanging out as much and she had this mean attitude all the time. so they decided to distance themselves from her by leaving her out while we all hangout. she didnt know this. as they were talking their shit abt her i agreed with all their points but i still felt empathy towards luci cause that was my best fucking friend. so what do i do? i tell her everything they said. i told her not to say anything to them about it. what does she do? she goes off on the girl that started the ""distancing"" thing. i TOLD her not to start shit and she did. the group called me and i was so scared i didnt want to answer and she goes, ""i would do it for you. if someone was talking shit you would want to hear it"". i shouldnt have let her convince me but i trusted her so much and i told her that this all better not get back to me...
i go on the call with them. without her in the room. and the girl she went off on was crying and i agreed with all her points again because i do think luci has a problem (i always add that shes in a toxic relationship and recently got sexually assulted by her boyfriend) ive tried to help her but she wont take it. 
saturday i was drunk w her in the city w a few local acquaintances and her bf was there. me in a group w her bf and some friends decided to play this game where u try to trip the other person over. i was trying to trip her bf over and he got rly touchy w me. as soon as he did i left and told her because it made ME UNCOMFORTABLE. 
the whole night she thought we were flirting. when ive told her SO MANY times that i hated him. 
a day goes by and luci decides to talk to the friend group. without me knowing. 
leading up to today where she was ignoring me the entire day. 
i knew something was up. so i called one of her close friends that she tells everything to because i was getting rly anxious about it. 

i found out that she twisted everything of what happened the day i told her they were distancing themselves from her. and now because i helped her find out information i had just lost all my friends. she hungout with them today. and left me out in the cold. kennedy (the girl she went off on) said she will talk to me in person when theyre ""ready""

i dont think i can ever forgive her. she was my bestfriend. it feels weird saying ""was""

she fucking lied to them. and betrayed me. 

all because she thought i was flirting with her dumbass sexual predator she calls her boyfriend.",depression,2021-12-07 16:34:13

748,rb17t2,I’m done.,3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rb17t2/im_done/,0,"I’m using voice to text for this so there might be some mistakes. 

Yesterday I went to the dentist. I go every six months. I’ve had a lot of problems with my teeth before and I get really really anxious going because of that. Long story short there was an incident where a dentist drilled cavities that didn’t exist because they wanted to make money. It’s been dealt with. But some of them were really deep and near nerves, and one of them was not taking the lidocaine, and I had to do it without any freezing. 

Yesterday I went to the dentist again. I like this dentist there’s nothing wrong with them. Apparently I have five cavities. I don’t drink pop, I don’t eat candy, I have maybe a few donuts and muffins from Tim Hortons. That’s it. I literally live off bland food like rice and oatmeal because of my stomach. I don’t understand how I have this many cavities. Some of the cavities I had before were caused by birth-control that I was taking. I’m on oral steroids right now and I’ve been taking them for a long time, so I’m sure that has something to do with it. But I’m so ashamed that I have cavities because I know I’ve skipped brushing my teeth the odd time. I don’t miss it for multiple days in a row though and I try to do it at least once a day. And if I don’t do it the second time that day I do use mouthwash which I know isn’t great if it’s not a substitute but it’s better than nothing. Because of my stomach issues I’ve barely even been able to eat anything that would be a food commonly associated cavities. The bill is $1462. 

They offered to do it under sedation but that’s a whole other bill I have to pay, and I already have to argue my parents to get this one covered because they are going to blame me. My dad doesn’t know yet, or he does and he just hasn’t called me, because I did tell my mom because she’s the one that holds the insurance. My student insurance will cover $534 of it. The rest of it is covered at 80% through my mom. They’re going to be laughing gas which is not covered at all and that’s $196. It’s not that I can’t afford it in January, because my funding comes in then, it’s that I’d rather not spend my money on it and I don’t see it as being worth it for me. Honestly I’m going to freak out regardless of whether or not they give me laughing gas. They gave me drugs this past time, from my nurse practitioner, and that barely did the track. So I’m gonna have to meet with her to figure out what to do because there’s literally nothing I can do. 

I had already felt like shit, and I already was upset with myself for multiple things involving school, work, and relationship things. It’s been getting really bad recently. And finding out that I had five cavities really sent me over the edge. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just got into see a new therapist this Thursday but I feel like I’m just going to be repeating myself once again. My previous therapist ended up closing practice suddenly after not responding to emails consistently and not showing up to appointments for months. I was fine for a while, but now I’m on a 9 to 10 month waiting list for a psychiatrist because nobody wants to touch my medication, and I’m starting all over again in therapy.

Until I began graduate school, I wouldn't have identified as someone with depression, just didn't feel that way ever.

But since I entered grad school, my mental state, energy, self-esteem, and outlook on life have taken a complete downturn. Its gotten to the point where I find myself unable to even work on my assignments, because I feel not only no energy (physical or mental, I'm constantly tired and sleep way too much and even when I get enough sleep I'm still wrecked) but no motivation, and now even a sense of terror at the idea of turning something in that isn't good enough. I literally can't complete anything and its  causing me to fail and possibly lose my chance at being here at all. 

Prior to grad school I had a number of interests and would make things and read a lot, but any enthusiasm for any of that is just gone. Even the thought of it feels foreign to me now. 

When the stress of school is at a high point around exams, I have panic attacks and a generalized wish to not be alive. I don't want to act on this thought but I sincerely hope that something happens to me, like a car accident or something. I never had suicidal thoughts prior to graduate school. It's quite literally ruined my life. But I feel like the alternative, quitting and not getting the degree, is just as bad. No employment or mediocre income, and no chance of being licensed in my field. When I think of that, I again wish to just be dead. 

I'm interested in whether these external factors are the sole reason for my depression and anxiety, or if they somehow might have triggered something already existing in me.

Feeling pain as my vision darkens.
Tho shuffling into my own demise.
Losing last few remnants of who I was.
Only showing what I could become.
The passing of one, to create a better other.
Death is the ultimate selfless act.
Pain is the only way one grows.
With out it we would be none learning.
Inhuman.

Knowledge is a painful weight we must all bare.
Like a snake it requires pain to grow.
Like shedding our skin.
Humans are the kin of devils. 
Tempting one with false hopes and promise. 
No such thing as a selfless act. 
All dues must be paid.
Just like relationships. 
All must be billed. 
In prices of blood and time
It can’t be built with dimes.
It seems us humans love to wonder into our own demise. 

Pain it’s a glorious thing. 
It’s the only feeling that’s persistent. 
It lingers years after the memories ended. 
Reliving trauma just multiples it.
Like a spider giving loving its brood. 
It never ends it always persists. 
We only ever pass it to one an other. 
We do not mean to. 
We might not know better.

It’s only human to remember.

I guess I’ll just start from the beginning. I’ll speed this up though because I don’t want to take up too much of your time. In like 6th or 7th grade I made friends online playing overwatch with a dude, like really good friends. I never had a buddy I could talk to casually and safely about literally anything from after school until like 4am. We used to have a joke where we’d just tell each other “Don’t be a bitch” for advice. It was laughable, really it was, because we both knew each other would give real advice anyway. It’s not funny anymore, but you probably understand why we thought so.

Back in April of this year, I had a decently healthy relationship with a gf I had for about 8 months, and got accepted into college and was graduating High School. My friend and I started FaceTiming and he started to drive. He told me he should stop and I told him to not be a bitch. We told each other jokes and laughed really hard. He turned to look at me for a brief moment, told me to take a hike, and hung up. I ended up calling him like 10 times later and he didn’t answer, that never happened. I ended up playing Minecraft with his little brother later, he must’ve been 7-8 years old. I’ve never heard a kid cry like that. He told me that my best friend got into a really bad accident. All he knew was that his head went through the windshield. I didn’t even have the balls to tell him what happened or that it was really my fault or that was sorry for it. My friend died the next morning.

I panicked, and I don’t usually do that. I felt enormous guilt, I still do. What had happened I felt was my fault entirely. So much so that I promised that it’d never happen again. I left my gf and all of my closest friends for their safety. That was the hardest decision of my life. They all tried to get me to stop but i didn’t listen.

Flash forward to about a few moths ago, I tried overdosing on pills. Obviously that didn’t work, I guess I’m inept? But I visited my grandparent’s house, he passed away over the summer. I started going through some old stuff. I found my grandpa’s old pistol and held it up. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I couldn’t do that either. I wussed out. I’ve tried drinking to forget or maybe honor my lost friend(s) but nothing works. I can’t sleep. Come to think of it I can’t really feel anything anymore either. I guess drinking allows me to smile for at least an hour or two? But tbh I haven’t slept normally in months since and I’ve had to resort to physically knocking myself out sometimes, I don’t like talking about how. I probably shouldn’t have written that down, but you get the point. 

I guess I’m asking for help but honestly maybe I don’t deserve it. It hasn’t fixed anything before. I’m sorry for writing so much, maybe I just needed to get this off my chest. I’m sorry",depression,2021-12-07 21:00:37

I’ve never struggled with depression before, so I’m not really sure if this is what it is. 

I’m temporarily working in another country which has always been my dream, and I love the job I am doing. But lately, I have had really low energy and motivation to the point where I don’t want to go out and do things like I used to. I always used to love getting out of the house and just walking around. AND I actually have a chance to explore another country right now and interact with people, but I just find it so hard to work up the energy to go out. I take 2-hour long naps very often as well, which is bizarre for me because I never even used to nap.

I also leave my dishes in the sink for days and let my room get a bit messy, and it’s just so hard for me to finally bite the bullet and clean it up. Again another lack of motivation.

I normally love to practice languages I’ve been learning and playing guitar in my free time, but lately I don’t feel motivated to do any of that. Normally in my free time right now I just scroll through social media.

And finally, I have had a pretty sucky appetite this past month. I’m not sure if it’s because I feel too lazy to make something for myself, but I also literally don’t feel the urge to eat much. So I’ve lost a little bit of weight this month.

On the other hand, it’s hard for me to think that this could be depression because why would this all come on so suddenly, when I’ve never suffered from depression before? I also don’t feel hopeless for the future or anything — I always have faith that things will get better. I still look forward to the future even though it’s uncertain. In fact, I have a trip back home coming up in 10 days that I am really looking forward to. I have an amazing support system—friends, family, and a romantic relationship—and I will see them all when I go back home. And when I do force myself to go out, I have lots of fun. It’s just when I come back home and lay in my bed that I feel like I fall into this trap. When I go home for the day, it’s hard to get me back out. Could anyone potentially explain this?

I wanted to help my mother with her struggles.  Because i was left with her.  I know my father wanted to be with me but couldnt.. he had his thing.. and he couldnt deal with my mother.  But i dont resent him for it.  Anyways.. 

But my time with my mother got to be too much eventually.  I left when I was 18 to forge my own life.  Little did I know that my past would follow me in my relationships.  In college I met and dated girls that were similar to me in interests and personality.  Had a normal dating college life.  Was great.  After college, ended up in a very well paying profession.  Ended up in a codepedent kind of relationship.  During the honeymoon phase, got a toy poodle.  I loved that dog.  He had so much personality.  I ravished him with love.  I ended up marrying.  My marriage was rocky. I didnt know what I was doing.  I didnt know what a healthy relationship was..  Needless to say, the marriage ended.  I ended it.  But more than that, my dog suffered.  Suffered throughout the whole thing.  He even broke one of his arms, and I only thought about how much time and money it would cost me to fix it.  And when the doctor did help him, it didnt even heal completely.  But during the marriage, I didnt even really care. Because I was thinking more of my own life.  And his leg didnt heal completely.  After the divorce, I took custody of the dog.  I chose to amputate my dogs leg to stop the pain from his broken leg.  He was still such a loving dog.  Even after that. My boy.  Even after 3 legs, he would love people.  Climb on their lap.  My boy.  It hurt very much.  
After the divorce and it was just me and my little fella... i started feeling I cant move around because of him.  I even starting getting angry for no reason.. not at him but just in general.  I started even feeling its just a dog and why should I let it stop me from living my life.  So I started looking into adoption or shelters.  I thought he would do better without me.  I find a shelter... brought him there.  They said if the dog was in too bad of a shape and that they would choose the moral ground of putting him to sleep should they not see a future in him..  me... i said okay.  I let my boy go, and as I did, and looked at him.. he looked back at me.. and said in a way, its okay.. i understand..  weve been through a lot.. im okay......  

My little dude.  I loved you deeply. Im sorry.  Im not a good person.. im selfish. I only think of myself.  I fucked around a lot.  My dog.  Please forgive me.  Ive lived a strange life after that.  Money?? Doesnt mean shit.  I know i am a horrible person.  I never wanted to be. Please forgive me little guy.   And one day.. i hope I can make it up to you.   In this life and the next.... Yes.. i am/was that guy....   just getting it off my chest..  horrible.. i know.",depression,2021-12-07 18:08:48

Bullied, and even got assaulted. Had a rough set of faculty. Attempted to kill my self once. Made it through. Fast forward 2.5 years to college, I had everything I craved for: small (5) set of supportive, caring and empathetic friends and a super supportive best friend. Then all of it took a turn for better or for worse. Everyone started getting on each others throat trying to pull each other down. I couldn’t watch everything crumble right in front of my eyes. Tried a lot of things including stupid ones because I didn't want to feel what I felt earlier. I felt fear of losing everything, fear of abandonment .My friends at first stood and made my mood better .Then I started noticing some distance from friends. They'd keep me out when I desperately needed. They'd randomly go out leaving me behind . I guess they had enough of my shit. My best friend was supportive a little longer and she herself  has had enough a little later. We started fighting a lot and eventually stopped talking/ texting for about 10-12 months. After 12 months after confrontation and compromise , we all started talking again after a lot of talk and a lot of opening up. Everything went okay but not smoothly. I sensed some disturbance in the atmosphere, like thy'd be in gangs talking, laughing and joking but when i join, i don't know how to describe it. Just not the same way it once used to feel. I've even learned that  one of my friend went behind my back and told others ,""He is an attention whore. He pretends to go around depressed in hopes to get people talking to him. Don't fall for it"". I was broken. My best friend told me not to take her seriously. What happened later was again a long story.

Fast forward to today: Everybody in my friends' group  moved on with their own lives. When I met one of my friend who stays close, he said he doesn’t talk to others a lot but truth is far from it. They hangout at restaurants , they video call a lot. In short they keep in touch a lot except I am not there . The only answer I got was they forgot. It wasn't on purpose.If you think we ditched you on purpose we'll suit yourself .I can understand if you forget  some living creature once or twice but more than 10 times....?. Now my best friend has moved to US in pursuit of Masters. She has told everyone she was going except for me. I had to hear it from another person. I just wanted to wish her good luck and give her a good byes gift. I tried calling her but she has a new number and never gave me hers. Nor does she reply to my messages. So I stopped trying. Earlier I used to play Warzone with couple of people and now they've ghosted me too.

&#x200B;

I am sorry it's just hard to type 5 years' worth of situation in paragraphs . I couldn’t even construct proper sentences. My hands are literally shaking. Now I don't have a pleasant home either. Surrounded by narcissistic people. My mother was mentally abused by my father's side and my father just stood idle. I wasn't blessed with a healthy  physique . I can go on and on about all of it but its too big .I was frail as a child and I am frail even now. All that abuse has turned my mother into something scary and I endured it hoping to find solace outside my house in form of friends. Now I lost everything . I failed. I lack the motivation to get up and do anything. I asked my doctor for some antidepressants  and he refused to prescribe me . He suggested to go see a therapist . I went there and the therapist charges 20% of my salary for 10 hr session every month. The therapy isn't great either. Instead of talking about my problems he goes on signing her own praise on how she tackled  all her problems and became a therapist. There are not a lot of therapists here. Now I am losing hope I'd get better. 

&#x200B;

I am not proud of all of my actions either. i have made mistakes , a lot of them. If I get a chance, I'd red o most of it. I am sorry for existing. My existence is a burden and I want to stop existing. My medical conditions go from bad to worse and my mental condition is not helping one bit. i just wish to have a normal life like the others. I just wish to redo my life or I wish to stop existing .",depression,2021-12-07 23:52:36

Ever since the pandemic started, I noticed a increasing decline in motivation, and not just for academics, but also in my personal life too. And at the same time I have also been feeling more lonely, I know I have family but I feel empty. I can’t still smile and laugh, just not as much as before. I question if anyone cares about me.

But I was able to ignore those feelings by drowning them out by playing video games, and I played them to the point where I’ve become addicted to video games. My health only made things worse as I was borderline obese. I slept late at night, began taking longer showers that were at least over an hour. I did poorly in college as a result. And when I tried to look for a job, I was rejected. 8 times, 8 times. And I continued in the same cycle until July 2021, when I decided to take to a college mental health counselor, I gave what I could and she said I had some sort of depression(I don’t remember if she specified). I went to a doctor and he said he agreed but directed me to their mental health services.

Then the worse came to pass, my families medical insurance was cut. Meaning I had to cancel all appointments as we didn’t do too well in terms of money. I began to get bored of the games I played. We still don’t have health insurance. I tried looking for a job but the result was the same. I began to lash out more often, mostly at my own mother.

I’m even considering joining the armed forces just so I can have health insurance and pull my life together, but my parents disagree. 

There was this[video](https://youtu.be/CBWdwDTn4vE)(skip to 46:02), it said something that has stuck with me since it was released. But now I’m starting to question it. I haven’t thought of suicide yet but god am I lonely and lost.

I’m genuinely scared that I’m going to be all alone, broken, as a failure. I’m scared that I’m becoming into some I don’t want to be. 

I hate this pandemic and I hate myself even more.",depression,2021-12-07 17:53:53

800,rb4v0l,Losing hope and reasons to live,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rb4v0l/losing_hope_and_reasons_to_live/,1," 

I have been dealing with depression for the past 3 years or so. Every single time I have a week or few weeks that go well, I think I have finally beat it, but it always comes back. I feel like this time though, it is significantly worse. I am getting suicidal thoughts again and I know for sure I would not act on them, but in my head they are very easy to rationalize now. I was doing very well for a few months. I stopped speaking with my therapist because there was nothing to really talk about. I started working a week ago and that is when things became bad again.

Prior to that, I only did side jobs mostly and made pretty much what I needed to get by in school. Now that I am getting older, though I am only 19, I need to start saving for other stuff as well as school. I took up a part time job at a subway type restaurant. It is easy work but it makes me feel very depressed. I think a large part of it is how much time I have to put in to receive very little pay on top of already losing pretty much half of my free time plus all the energy it takes to do the job. I don't know if I should look for other work or just stick through it. I feel like no matter where I go I will feel like this. What makes everything worse is I feel like I will feel like this for the rest of my life.

I feel like life is not for me. The most harrowing thing was what happened this weekend. I was in the er for something that could've been life threatening. I would have needed surgery if I had what the doctors suspected I had. A BIG part of me hoped I had it, despite there being a pretty high chance of me dying on top of the huge medical costs. It was not because the thought of death was appealing, it was more so because I knew I would be given a break with zero responsibilities. When I learned I was fine, I was relieved but also disappointed. I probably sound very privileged, but those were my honest thoughts.

I have felt this way every single time I have worked some minimum wage job, but I do not have many other options. Is it worth looking around for a different job? I have never tried retail so that is really the only hope I have, but I don't even know if that will be much better. Part of me is losing hope on life as well. It just doesn't seem that interesting to me. I have interests and things I want to pursue but it's hard for me to look at a 20-40 hour work week and see that genuinely as okay. A big part of me would honestly rather be dead.

It was easy to find hope before. I was unemployed, broke, out of school, wasn't pursuing hobbies or seeing friends. I thought that once I got my life in order, I would be fine. Now I am working, on medication, back in school, have hobbies, dreams, etc. but life still doesn't interest me. If I'm being honest, if my loved ones didn't care if I was to die, I probably would kill myself.",depression,2021-12-07 23:31:15

Have to actively try not to self harm ( failed last week and ended up giving in) 


Lowered self esteem- have been avoiding looking at my body in the mirror 


I definitley hate myself more than I have in a long time


And I’m Failing my classes, but actually not feeling too bad since I’ve become more numb and accept my future is probably going to be awful 



HOWEVER. **I recently started going to the gym daily.** and like I said I’ve been eating more. Could I still be depressed despite this? In the last month I’ve been very obsessive about grooming too so I shower daily cut my nails wash my face etc. 

Btw I lost my job cuz I started wanting to self harm bc of it",depression,2021-12-07 18:08:10

829,rb2k2g,Trying to find purpose,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rb2k2g/trying_to_find_purpose/,0,"Hello everyone,I have had trouble with something for a while and I don't really know who to turn to or how to go about finding some resolution. I have battled for a long time with depression and sometimes seeing a point to life. I won't make this post any longer than it needs to be but I guess I struggled to figure out certain key aspects in my life. What to do with my life, where to live, what I see in my future and who I might spend it with. I would generally describe myself as more of an introvert but I try to socialize and interact with people when I need to even though it can feel physically exhausting especially when it's new people.  
While a number of those things I mentioned do contribute to my depression, I would say not having someone in my life (girlfriend or partner) has probably contributed more to my loneliness than I sometimes want to admit. I've been told I'm a good looking guy and have some great qualities but with the lack of success I have had finding a partner it's made me question that more often than not. And being I am in my late 30's it starts to feed into that fear that you are cursed or not that great.  
Now about 9-10 years ago, with the rise of online dating i decided to give it a go as I hadn't really dated anyone to that point . And while I would sometimes have a bit of matching with someone and sometimes even meeting them, it generally never progressed past a first date. Late last year I met someone that seemed really great. I found her very attractive, we had some good chats and video chatted a few times. It was during the height of the first pandemic plus she was living in Orlando at the time so it was the only option available. Anyway I know she was pretty busy with work so it was sometimes hard to chat with her. However it was hard to know if it was going anywhere with her schedule and the distance. Anyway a bit of time passed and I reconnected with her and she mentioned she was taking a trip away to Ireland to possibly move there. We talked about the trip and I commended her on getting away and even exploring the idea of moving as it really helps one grow (I've moved countries a few times in my life).  
Once again a bit of time passed and she finally got back to me saying she had a great trip and was going to make the leap and move to Ireland. I was a bit disappointed we hadn't met and it seemed unlikely we would maybe ever meet. Then I noticed on her social media a bit later she started posting again and taking a trip around Europe. Once again we chatted for a little bit and she mentioned she was doing a European trip. Again I wished her all the best but eventually I started seeing photos that she was posting with a guy, pointing towards her being with someone pretty serious . I was disappointed but I couldn't really do anything about it. Then came the bigger blow, a few months after that and not much posted, she posted she had married the guy. I eventually discovered that she had actually met the guy online and went originally to Ireland to meet him (the main reason for her original trip).  
Now generally when things hadn't worked out with someone I had met online or even girls I had met in person, I could sometimes be a bit sad when it didn't work out or I didn't feel there was a connection but this hit me like a ton of bricks. I was already pretty down with seeing her with her fella, but to see the marriage thing felt like a massive blow and hurt me tremendously. I waited till I got home from work and for some reason cried for ages about it. Maybe it was also the fact that she would travel all that way for this guy but never even give the impression she would have done the same with me or asked me to visit her.  
I have always believed that my life shouldn't be defined by if I am in a relationship but for some reason this just felt like my lowest point. Maybe it was a combination of factors as well, not sure about my future career in what I do, not having some great friends to talk to, having family living halfway around the world and not knowing what to do.  
It also feeds into my insecurity and just the years upon years of hurt and lack of being alone just made me feel like what is the purpose at times of life. I used to think about my future and feel like I could still see something good, but these days I really struggle to feel good about anything. I feel like I just go through the motions of life. Work, exercise, eat, sleep and repeat. I know anytime I have tried to talk to people about any of these things, it is invariably followed up by questions that I don't  know how to answer. It just saddens me even more that I don't know how to get through this or what to do. I try to smile and put on a brave face but deep down feel incredibly sad. And I find more and more lately that I feel way more emotional than I ever have.  
I'm sorry for such a long post but I was hoping to just talk about it and maybe get some advice about  not feeling cursed. It feels  like my life is more of a groundhog day in that it feels like nothing is changing or progressing. That I am doomed to just keep going along this lonely path with nothing to look forward to.",depression,2021-12-07 21:44:52

During my childhood I would lie to people around me and pretend I wasn’t dying inside. Pretend I wasn’t experiencing abuse. Pretend I was happy. Pretend I didn’t try to kill myself. Pretend I didn’t self harm. Pretend it was my fault that these things happened to me because I deserved it.

I’m now 27 and I have to pretend to be somebody else because I worry people won’t like the real me. I pick up on peoples personalities around me, hoping they won’t see who I really am. But I know they don’t even like the mask wearing version of myself, I know they won’t like who I truly am.

When I open myself up to people, when I let them see who I truly am they don’t understand. They don’t listen when I tell them I’m drowning. They don’t listen when I tell them I’m hurting. They tell me “everyone has some sort of mental health issues, everyone has problems” while I know this is true, I feel like mine run so deep they are rotting me from the inside out.

I’m starting a new job on Monday and I had been invited to a Christmas party and the entire time I tried to put on a mask, a mask of happiness. I didn’t recognize myself, made myself feel sick with the sickly sweet version of me I want people to believe.

I don’t like letting people in, it makes me too vulnerable but I desperately want to be seen. I feel like I could be the mask I put on but I feel I’m too far gone and truthfully have no idea who I really am.",depression,2021-12-07 13:00:05

My mom and my sister are my only companions so I guess I'm a-grade weird. My ex friend was busy a lot so I didn't really have anyone to do anything with even when she was around. But I went from 2 friends to 1 friend and the one left is married and told me she had a week of fancy dinners planned so she only had one free day that week Soo... 

The problem is I've never had a ton of friends. Idk why. I moved a few times in school. I feel like strong bonds are created in middle school and I missed out. I lost my friend group from high school because of a rumor and had to start over senior year. I was in a wedding with the girl who started the rumor last year and the bride told me to get over the rumor. But part of the reason I find that so hard is because that shit happens everywhere. In college, my jobs teased me to my face or bitched behind my back to management. I had a group project that went to the teacher and complained about me. A friend lifted my resume off indeed and got a job when I couldn't. Everyone just gets weird when they decide they don't like me. People don't tell me, they just act weird. It hurts. Everything hurts so bad. 

I'm trying to make friends on bumble bff and it fucking sucks. I quit sometimes because it's just so much rejection. I try to be nice and interesting and interested but it doesn't seem to matter. I have a few online friends and they're both acting so weird right now. I don't know what I did. If they don't want to talk, I wish they would ghost instead of slow fading me. Slowfade sucks.

Some background knowledge about my self would be that I am 17 and female. To the age of 9 I constantly got abused by my father. He would abuse me physically (beating me and my mother) and mentally( screaming at me and saying hurtful things etc.). Now obviously I don't live with him anymore because my parents got divorced when I was about 9 but after a few years I developed PTSD and depression. Besides that I wasn't really popular around my peers and I never really learned how to create healthy bonds to other probably because we where moving a lot and I needed to change schools. I did got bullied a bit in school because I used to be overweight and a nerd. Now I also learned that I got diagnosed with a adolescence crisis where I just struggle to talk to people around my age. I do have friends but it is only superficial.

Now my problem is that I struggle to not only have some sort of emotional stability. I do go to therapy but it isn't really enough for me. I struggle with shame and not feeling lonely the entire time. Right now I am in a deep depressive episode and it is hard for me to get out of it. I try to distract myself with my interests but I only feel apathy towards them.

I never did something like this befor and I hope that it was clear in a way.

My psychiatrist recommends moving out of my family’s house as soon as possible (loud stepsisters and stressful/unpredictable) and I think it’d help too. 
I don’t have other family or close friends (besides person I’m hoping to move in with); might try posting on other subs too. I’m open to anywhere in the USA. Thanks for reading/considering.

I love my partner, and I want our relationship to work. But I am convinced that I am absolute shit and that he deserves better. I am convinced that I cannot be the healthy partner he deserves; that I cannot provide him with the happy healthy fulfilling relationship he deserves. I breakdown too much, I talk about myself negatively too much, I do not work a job that allows me to live independently, I do not have much money saved at all, I am awkward, I am anxious, I am ugly, I am selfish, I am a coward, I am just a bad person. 

I want to be with him, but I also feel obligated to “set him free” so that he can do better. But I do that by constantly telling him the above and asking him to leave me - rather than actually leaving him because I don’t actually want us to break up. 

But I told him to leave me again tonight. I told him that I would never stop telling him to leave me because I need to protect him and because he deserves better and I am shit. He told me he is devastated. That I am being unbelievably cruel. That I am not freeing him but rather that I am causing him to question if I ever want to be better and causing him to lose his faith in looking for the good in people ever. He told me I don’t want this relationship. He told me not to contact him for a few days while he struggles with all of this.

I hate myself. For hurting him. For pushing and pulling him. For being who I am. For maybe finally truly losing him. And I just want to curl into a ball and die. He has every right to leave and he should leave. I just hope he doesn’t. But I don’t know. I ruined things. I completely ruined them. And if by some miracle he doesn’t leave this time, I know he’ll have lost his faith in me and some love for me. And I know I will ruin things again. I want to throw up. I just want to be happy and healthy and to be able to be the the partner he deserves. But I am irredeemably broken. He deserves better. And I can’t believe I hurt him so much. And I hate myself for it. And I want to die.

It costs a fortune tosee one and i would rather not without a proper reason. I don't want to be on antidepressants because i feel too carefree and can't study while on them . I guess i have to try again or idk .what to do i just wished i could evaporate in the air .

I'm a 20 y/o woman, facing a dilemma that I wanted advice on but feel too embarrassed to talk to anybody about as they might judge me. For starters, I suffer from anxiety and depression. I rarely go out because I'm so disgusted with all of the weight I've gained since the penny era. With all of that said, I met this really amazing guy online (I never planned on liking him or talking to him) We've been talking otp and texting for 7 months and facetimed once. I've built this incredible connection with him like I didn't know was possible. Problem is, we've never met irl... and he literally lives a couple of minutes away. *\*This post was from a few months ago, I'm adding on to this and we are now NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS in the same apartment complex, I didn't plan this and never wanted this to happen. Actually, my worst nightmare, and I'll tell you why.\**

I kept making excuses for not seeing him before because I am feeling terribly insecure about my appearance right now and I'm basically a hermit, I barely go out to have fun, and being a full-time student at a university (that I mostly attend online) is my only current occupation. But y'all, he's the sweetest and most understanding man I've ever talked to and he's interested in *me*. The emotional bond I have with him is so beautiful, we've cried together at 4 am as he unpacked his hurts like him being SA'd- something he's never told, anybody. I'm so honored for him to have trusted me like that, I liked him even more getting to know him. He's a healthy communicator and taught me how to be one. Nobody's ever liked me like and he finds me rare and special. I didn't know guys like him existed. \**We don't talk anymore but still have each other on some social medias\**

He's tall and very handsome, he is nearly identical to Mark Sloan from Grey's Anatomy (i don't make his head big lol) and he's pretty popular locally where I live, I live in a pretty small town. I thought he'd be a cocky/player pretty boy but he's actually quite literally the opposite. I'm not into social media that much like he is which is why he's interested in me, I think. I'm also insecure because of all these girls that throw themselves at him constantly in his comments and irl. We don't talk anymore and it's my fault for being insecure (I didn't tell him about my mental health) and also it's totally my fault for never taking things to the next level aka going out. \**And now, I just moved into this new building with my family and found out he's my next-door neighbor! I suspected that it could've been the same building (from his social media posts) and by the time I found out, (my sisters and mom spied) it was too late! we have already signed the lease and let go of our old place. We couldn't go back, no matter how much I wanted to. I'm so terrified now and my anxiety is even worse now than ever before. I literally don't know what to do because I wanted to take things further prior to this discovery but ON MY OWN TERMS. and now? I'm like ahh he can't see me!\**

I'm scared I'm missing out on a really great guy though and am not living up to my own potential. Literally, the whole reason why we didn't work out was because I didn't want to meet him even though he kept begging and pleading. I really hurt him everytime I said no as he's told me. He once wrote me a long paragraph about how he's hurt two months into us talking saying: ""seeing me shouldn't be a hassle seeing as we're neighbors"" Now, We're literally NEIGHBORS! talk about speaking this into existence. but the thing is, I never manifested this and Idk what this means:/ This whole situation is bananas. I can't make this ish up! What are the odds of him being my neighbor happening? I don't know what to do and im going insane!

I am super sorry for the long post but it’s gotten to the point where I have to say something. Being a single dude in my 20s makes me want to die.

My girlfriend and I broke up and it was really for the best because she was emotionally manipulative towards me constantly, but I knew she has a lot of past trauma so I tried really hard to be patient with her. Well, when I went to her place after the breakup and slept over because we talked about getting back together. 

Well, I caught her texting a guy she was seeing and sleeping with while she was in bed with me, and we had a huge argument about it later that night because she lied to me about it to my face. Now before you get upset, I get she was single and can make her own choices that’s not what I was upset about. I was upset because we were talking about getting back together and she lied to my face about it and texted this guy all night while I was there. She had gotten mad at me over being around other girls after we broke up and even yelled at me when she saw me with female friends once. Now as an adult I’m willing to admit I should never yell at anyone and I’m ashamed for getting so upset. But she told me that I was a terrible person and a piece of shit for talking to her like that and that I was no different from her other past boyfriends who were terrible to her and she regretted the relationship (of 8 months). Among other really hurtful things she said. 

Well that left me heartbroken. I was insanely sad but I understood that space was good and so when she blocked me on social media I completely got the message and wanted to respectfully give her space. She reached out a week later and wanted to talk on the phone so I agreed and I immediately just wanted to apologize for raising my voice at all because it’s never something I do with people I care about. She did not apologize for any of the things she said and told me that’s how she felt in the moment so the statements were justified. She told me she doesn’t take them back at all. 

She told me further that her and her family lost a great deal of respect for me. (I don’t know where her family comes into this). And that the guy she was texting was just her friends with benefits and she wanted me to know that I wasn’t getting in the middle of anything serious. Well that of course also made me feel awful because well yea who the hell wants to hear that, and I’m fairly certain she said it to quell her own fears about looking like a shitty person and to brag to me she’d moved on. 

I ended the conversation near then and respectfully and politely said if we’d like to be friends she can’t say things like she said or be in my face about her new love life. Fast forward a month from then and about a month ago from now. She calls me and gets insanely upset with me because she thought I was sending her rude messages from a new phone. Of course I wasn’t because thats so incredibly low and she knows that is never something I would even consider doing because it’s absurd. She then apologized for getting upset with me once she realized how absurd it all was, and then told me she just had to check because it wasn’t her friends with benefits either. I stopped her and said I didn’t want to hear about that. Then I proceeded to healthily block her in everything until I got a message on Facebook messenger which I forgot to block her on getting mad at me for blocking her. I told her I needed space and to reflect on everything and she got mad and told me to have a nice life, but it was really in the tone of “have a shitty life”

Well jokes on her I already do lol. Take that. But anyways yea so I’ve been single now for four months and my confidence is on the floor. Having match after match on hinge and tinder leading to ghosting, one time dates with no mutual connection or interest, and just feeling unwanted, unloved and lonely hurts. Especially knowing she’s probably out there after everything that happened being able to interact as easily as she wants in the dating world as a girl. 

I’m borderline ready to end it. I just simply don’t know what to do or how to fix my life. And I know what the comments are gonna say “you have to learn to be happy for yourself first!” You ain’t wrong. But like I feel so hurt and played by this whole situation that I can’t move on at all and it’s killing me. Lost sleep, the occasional good shower cry, I’m even listening to Coldplay. 

I know there are some jokes sprinkled in here and there but seriously I’m unwell and I am so desperate for help or human connection that I have turned to Reddit. Men aren’t allowed to talk about their feelings, they don’t get compliments, single guys just float around aimlessly until someone comes along again. But until then I don’t know how much longer I can float.

I've got a dead end minimum wage job that will never get me out of my grandparents house, I have 2 accidents both at my fault because stress and attention deficit, and I have no idea what tools are available to me to help me through this. 
This is a cry for help, I don't know what else to do. I can't afford treatment really, I have no idea how to set up assistance because nobody in my life ever taught me how and I don't even know how to get close to providing for myself. I'm on the autism spectrum with AD, I'm convinced, but I have no way to confirm that because nobody bothers to acknowledge that seriously. I'm absorbed into my videogames and it's a struggle to even get myself to move from there half the time. I have no pride in anything, and it all feels like it's out of my control. 
I have dealt with a traumatic past too, but I don't really care to get into detail with that. 
Right now, everything seems so impossible, like, I just have no clue how to approach making good change in my life. I need a mentor, an actual set of parents, a role model, and I never had one. I resent grandparents that I live with, my father is worse off than me, and my mother is almost evil. I'm afraid I have no way to prove I'm worth a damn to a potential someone that could give me a chance and I don't want to continue to be unhappy, unsatisfied and forever chasing my fleeting dreams because of all the common sense I lack. 
I'm far less emotional about many things but I've rather just been numb. I don't have that same emotional drive anymore, not to do anything creative with music, my supposed passion. I barely find anything actually funny anymore, I just gotta admit that I don't really feel love for my girlfriend, and I just go through the motions, not saving many memories to look back upon. Everything I do to try to push emotions out feels fake to me. I'm just sick of it, and I have thought many time of letting myself going full nihilist, but I'm convinced I couldn't even commit to that. 
Overall I really do feel like I'm just persisting rather than loving or accomplishing anything, and my time is quickly running out cause I'm gonna have to be on my own eventually, right?",depression,2021-12-07 13:40:47

I don’t want to succeed there’s no point in even trying because I don’t try I don’t do positive visualization 
I can’t escape like I used to be able to just close my eyes and pretend I have wings so I could fly around escape anymore I’m trapped here.
And I just feel like more bad things are going to happen
Right not I’m sitting here In my bed at 12 22 with a job interview tmw and I can’t sleep
I started to think of ways to kill myself
If I should kill my self first then why I shouldn’t it would hurt I’m scared to I used to say because everyone would be sad but I don’t really care anymore about anything except sex snd getting high sometimes but then I either scratch the itch or the feeling fades and I’m back to hating every moment
Im trapped here
Then I start to think what will happen if I don’t kill myself I live a life full of suffering 
I never make something of myself I live at my moms untill Either she dies or my sisters make me leave because I’m a bum
Everyone from school was right I am a loser and it shows just by looking at me
I hate myself I hate everyone I hate everything I get old i think about how good it used to be suffer repeat more bad things to make things worse lose my teeth I lose my hands  Through many financial failures and trying to make myself feel better i die with no money or I do something so terrible that I have to Kms anyway so I might as well just get it Over with right?
Even if I do make it “making it” seems like an abstract concept put in my head by watching too many rap videos so a I have no idea what making it actually looks like and b if I do make it or at least what I think that is getting rich I guess then most likely I will still feel the same way just with allot of money.I’ve had times where I feel good but it just feels fake or like I don’t deserve it or that I get an ego boost and just start being a condescending asshole or I do things that just don’t make sense that everyone tells me not to do and I know it’s not even what I want
Like I feel like the person I am when I feel good is just oblivious to all my bad qualities.
I don’t want to just feel good and think good things about me self and that be a lie based on evidence on how Ireact ands the things I have done I’m  not a good person. I can justify that and say that oh humans are situational and opportunistic and is there really a good and bad but that’s just rationalization and agian basically a lie. I wish it wasn’t a bad thing to kill yourself. If there was a pod that would use your remains or energy to benifit other people than that would be a better use of my body than being alive I think I would use it. I want to change and to be a good person but I don’t know how, I think I was just born this way or was formed by abuse and neglect. I want to pick myself up from my boot straps but all my boots have laces not straps. My af1 have straps but they really aren’t boots. And if I can’t make myself into the person I want to be and have the things and money I want and not be poor anymore then I just want to escape I don’t want to live in this universe. Hook my brain up to the matrix and make me think I’m a renegade space ship pilot who has a small farm on a distant planet and smuggels contraband and pod races occasionally
It used to be so much easier to escape. I remember reading Harry Potter and just being transported to that world. I love worlds I get obsessed with them sometimes like the Star Wars world they just seem so much cooler than this one.",depression,2021-12-07 13:31:44

So, I'm a college student, pretty introverted and without any good friends. Any friends i made here just ended up ghosting me after a while. Used to already have a bit of depression, and that used to make it even worse. Had just one good friend in school, but we went to different colleges, and eventually he stopped talking to me that often. About 8 years ago, i joined a certain manga's discord server. Made a buncha friends there, who were really relatable. Really loved talking to them, and it realllly helped my depression. Even tho my irl was shit, i always used to get happy thinking about my friends online. Really thought they were pretty good and geniune friends.I reallt tried to be interesting and be interested in their talks. Used to put a lot of effort talking to them, hoping they won't just start ghosting me like others. But like a month ago, they all started acting wierd towards me. Kinda started ghosting me and stuff. Don't think i had ever done anything to disappoint anyone. Decided to not talk there for a while and focus on my project. Had been a week, and no one even asked me if i was fine or not. That's really hurting me. Really ironic how most of them used to rant about people ghosting them and not having friends, and they ended up doing the same to me. I decided to just get over it and forget about them, but haven't been able to concentrate on anything because of that. Been feeling really down after that.

Ever since I’ve dropped out I’ve basically dropped out of society as a whole, I spend the whole day in bed and It’s been like that for years now…I’ve isolated myself from my friends and family as well. My friends and family have labeled me selfish and they think that that I’ve chosen the life of “friends and partying” when the truth is I can’t even bring myself to leave my apartment, I’m so anxious that I get scared when I hear a knock on the door, I’m scared of leaving my apartment to take a walk to get some sun because I feel like everyone is judging me. I feel like everyone in my complex watches my every move hence why I can’t even sit outside. I’ve deteriorated so much that I’m constantly thinking about suicide, constantly thinking about the most pain free way to go out…I’ve been in this vicious cycle so long that I don’t even see a way out. I lied to my mother who’s been funding my studies about graduating twice and now I’m lying about being employed when I’m not. The only thing I do is eat and sleep, showering and getting haircuts seem like a near impossible task to complete…I can’t talk to anyone because my whole life is a lie, I’m Alienated and I’m at a point where I feel like my only option is suicide…everything that can go wrong has gone wrong in my life and it’s mostly because of this demon called anxiety…I’ve been isolated so long that I’ve developed erectile dysfunction, constant chest pains, I struggle with sleeping because my mind is always racing and I blame myself for my current state. So all in all I dropped out of college and about it and my life has never been the same ever since.

Covid hit. Lost my job, relationship, gyms shut down, at the same time as a shoulder injury. Put me completely out of commission. It all went to hell at once. 

Lost literally everything I had in life. Even all my friends ghosted me.
Filled the void with lots of alcohol… then cocaine, Xanax, Molly, and so on. 

Overdosed on Xanax which made me finally force myself to sober up. 

Worked so hard to sober up and get my head straight.
Covid restrictions finally relaxed, found a new job, worked my way up, now I’m making more than my old job ever paid me.

Thought it was all over and I could move on,

Along with depression I’ve also developed anxiety and started to have panic attacks pretty constantly, the pandemic has been especially rough as I lost 5 family members over the span of about a year, and didn’t get to say goodbye to any of them really. The place I live had strict regulations during the pandemic so funerals either didn’t happen, or were very brief. I also lost touch with many of my friends and developed an issue where I struggle to communicate with people, even if they reach out to me. I’ve never felt so lost and lonely in my life, and I guess this is my attempt at venting or just speaking out into the void? I thank anybody that took the time to read this, and I hope that you find hope in whatever struggle you’re personally facing.",depression,2021-12-07 12:01:11

This fear based mind control (the existential threat of eternal damnation) really took root in them and ruined our family. I wish they could see it. I wish they could be okay with not knowing whatever the truth is, for surely, whatever the ""truth"" is, it's stranger than our wildest imaginations, veritably an ineffable grandeur greater than our limited minds could ever conceive and not at all an ultimatum of our eternal existence. Its okay to be lost and admit you don't know, but don't let your fear limit others autonomy, let them discover their own truth for themselves. God doesn't need anyone to believe in them that is such a narcissistic thing to believe of the Divine.

But life has appeared to have stolen even that from me. I barely feeling anything when I try my old methods. The sad songs or audio clips, looking at triggering pictures, etc. Nothing does the trick. Maybe the tiniest pang to my heart… or sinking feeling in my stomach. But I can’t cry. I can’t lose myself and let it all out.

Perhaps I’m so sad and depressed that I feel nothing else. Maybe I’m so used to it, that my brain just thinks I’m numb and not feelings things.

I’m just a shell. It has ate away at everything I once was as a happy little boy. Every time I walk outside I feel like I have 500 sniper rifles pointed at me.

I see these people I hangout with die laughing of a simple meme, and i struggle to even smile. There is just so much stress caught up in my head, and anger towards the world, towards people. Even with being on a benzodiazepine, and therapy, I still feel the same way. I feel like a ticking time bomb waiting for someone to try to jab at me, then explode. I can’t keep living like this. Staying in my dark room all day Listening to depressing music like Linkin Park, trying to find someone who understands my pain, and the monster inside me. Every time I hear people talking I always assume it’s about me, bad things about me, and I can’t seem to convince myself I’m wrong. I am living in hell with so many mental problems. I’ve been keeping all of this bottled up inside for so many years. Everyday I visualize myself getting hit by a truck, or never waking up after overdosing. It’s so comforting and soothing. The thought of death. I don’t feel like I have a purpose on this earth. I just feel like everyone my age is so far ahead of me and has their life planned out, while I’m just trying to get through hour by hour.

I feel like a mix of a introvert and extrovert (ambivert?)

I also feel like a nuisance to other people's friendships and conversations, and I'm probably the only one out of few who don't have any close friendships at the moment (other than two people from the southern US) in my school. Whenever I see a group of friends being together and talking, I just compare that to my somewhat miserable life. Not saying that people should stay away from each other for my sake, just something I wanted to point out.

My social skills are pretty shit too. I respond to a lot of various comments with single words like bruh, oh ok, damn, etc. and it's so hard to congratulate people on achievements not because I don't want to but because I feel like congratulating makes a lot of noise and me making that much noise in public settings is sweat's paradise, and also if the message goes wrong it would be super awkward.

I stress the importance of social groups and culture and stay away from some just so as to not embarrass or stress myself.

Self esteem is pretty low too, as I compare myself to others a lot, and I feel like I'm one of the worst people in the school in character and a lot of other factors. 

If you're wondering about counselling, I was going to make a teen counseling account, but well it cost a lot of money. Might be worth it but for now I'll stick to forums.

Also on sleep, I'm still under 18 and I have a lot of times I sleep at 2 or 3 AM on school days (it's 10:43 PM now, not too bad in my standards lol), which sums it up pretty well I guess :P

sorry if this was low-content or too specific, I've been holding for too long, that's all.

Though when I am not a minor anymore, I'd be able to pursue a lot more. Maybe I'll celebrate going into a Subway by myself or a museum or something like that 😄

TLDR COVID-19 situation sucks it gave me social anxiety, I feel like a nuisance to other people's social life, my social skills are garbage, I tried to make a counseling account but failed, I have a bad sleep schedule, low self-esteem, I'd like to achieve more when I am older, epik 😎",depression,2021-12-07 10:28:37

i just feel like i have to half ass the less important things because i’m so drained mentally. ive been procrastinating for the last several weeks and i get really horrible anxiety just thinking of starting an assignment. ive been sleeping a lot and now i basically have 3 papers and two presentations due at the end of this week. i know it’s my fault but i’m so unmotivated. i just dread every single day. 

i know it will be over in a week and a half but right now is such a nightmare.",depression,2021-12-07 13:07:06

My wife is the best part of me. Somehow I've met one of the greatest people on the planet. Kind, generous, caring, someone who looks out for the downtrodden without any consideration. The patron saint of helpless creatures decided that I was the person they loved. How could anybody be so lucky, and still find a way to ruin it.
I have been surrounded by people trying to help me and none of it seems to actually matter, because I do not want their help. I want them to move on. She deserves far better than what I can give her. I wanted to fade away so she can move on with her life, find the person she is actually meant to be with. I don't think it's me. I just want to disappear.",depression,2021-12-07 06:39:32

I had a child at 18 and legally yeah I was an adult, mentally... Not so much... I found out I was pregnant at 17 years old.... I was in my first semester in college... It changed a lot for me, I was so devisated. I had already lived a life of unhappiness... I rarely felt happy at home as a child. Not because of what we didn't have but because I had a mom who barely showed me love and an absent father that I had no information about. Along with that I lost my oldest sibling randomly to an air born virus. Life was off to a bad start... I was 7 when he died. I remember it vividly. I was so hurt that the only person who treated me well was gone. Back to my adulthood.... I started a relationship with my sons dad and it was horrible. The little self esteem that I was starting to build was diminshed. I never had anyone to go to about these types of things... especially not my mom. I was trying so hard to still accomplish things in life that I planned prior to pregnancy. I didn't want a child that young, I wanted to go off to college out of state my second semester and find myself for once. Anywho after me and my son father split, I spent most of my life single. Aside from that I was mostly depressed and had lack of self confidence. I never pursued acting like I thought I would do when I left for college and fell into living a basic life trying to satisfy people who never treated me well! Now as I approach 32 next month, I feel sadness that I let my 20's slide by... esp since I am in acting and I look at all the wonderful things actors do. I look at their pictures when they were young until old age and realize that I am at the mid point of my beauty because I wasted my teens and 20's not to mention the depression in the 20's which didn't help my face.

However the lasts months I already was struggling, but the last weeks it’s getting worse. 

I feel so lonely on this world. First I never had a girlfriend, went on a date or whatever. It really hurts me, because I tried so hard and never got any results out of it. I am really scared I will end up forever alone. I hate it. Tried online dating, but just not a single girl matched with me. I am such a loser. Second I really am feeling lonely because the pandemic. I do not see my friends nearly as often as before. I can always text them, but that is nowhere near the interaction in real life. And I something feel that I am disturbing them. 

I just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I am going to need to find a job, which is already hard. But I don’t have the mental energy to do it all anymore. I feel so lonely every day again. I feel like I don’t really belong on this world. I am here, but also I am not. When joining social activities I am there, but at the same point I am just there. I don’t really feel that I am part of it. And afterwards I feel even more lonely. I really struggle with what others think of me. When someone doesn’t reply to my text I already start to think: “what have I done wrong”? 

My wish is to get a good job, meet a girlfriend, start a family and spend good times with friends. But in reality I have never had a girlfriend and I have no idea where to find one and if I will ever find one, I haven’t found a job yet, I don’t think I will ever start a family alone and idk about the rest of my social life.

960,ramhht,I never thought it would happen to me…,3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ramhht/i_never_thought_it_would_happen_to_me/,2,"The title is exactly what it sounds like. Honestly I don’t even know what’s going on nowadays, everything just seems to be falling apart around me. Ever since I left high school I realize now that I’ve just been kinda lost. 

After high school I tried to do a number of courses but they didn’t come to fruition for one reason or another and now I’m trying again but this time I don’t have the fees to pay the course and it’s just a number of things that are just adding up to make my experience as negative as possible. I know that the Covid pandemic made it even worse because I was just stuck at home all day in my small little room with my negative intrusive thoughts playing on repeat day in and day out. I pretend I’m OK because I don’t wanna worry the people around me that I care about, but honestly I’m crumbling away inside my mind. I go from moments where I literally break down from all the things happening around me to bits where I literally don’t care about anything and it seems like I’m OK for a while until it comes back.

I (used to) enjoy making music, editing anime and playing competitive smash but I can’t even bring myself to do even one of those things for an extended period of time anymore because I just feel like a complete failure and it’s taken a toll on my ability to do any of it; every time I try to do even one of these things and end up failing, it just makes me feel even worse. It hurts the most because the things that used to make me happy I barely have time to do anymore and when I do, I literally just stare at the screen for like one hour and end up doing absolutely nothing and then just going straight to sleep because I’m mentally exhausted from feeling empty day in day out. It’s crazy because the super high standards I used to have for myself, I can’t even fathom reaching anymore.

I also hate asking for help because I don’t want to inconvenience people because of my own uselessness that I brought upon myself. It’s likely I will never even ask someone to help me ever because I think what I’m going through is completely minor compared to what some people are going through. Even through all that I can feel that my mom and dad are instinctively worried about me and it hurts because I don’t wanna be a burden onto them even more than I already have been. I don’t even have the right to complain to them because my younger brother has been through worse shit (health-wise) than I have and he seems to be doing completely fine mentally. I don’t want to worry him either and I don’t wanna show any weakness in front of him cos what would he think?

I actually used to be a super optimistic and happy person, I could not even picture myself frequenting a sub like this because I thought depression and anxiety was something that could never happen to me because I was “mentally untouchable”. I also used to frequent church a lot and was really active in my faith, but all that has come to a halt. I honestly don’t believe God hears me anymore and if he does, he’s ignoring me and allowing the devil to have free reign over what he wants to do with my life. Of course I can never tell this to my family. Honestly music/video games and anime are the only three consistent things in my life that are keeping me going and it’s slowly losing its luster. I’m literally anxious every single day and non-sociable to even my family and my closest friends. I can tell I’m getting more and more negative and irritable by the day and little things will just get me unreasonably pissed. I know for a fact that social media exacerbates every single part of what I’ve spoken about but I’m part of the generation that can’t seem to step away from it for an extended period of time. The fact that I’ve even had thoughts that I wouldn’t even like to be here anymore scares me to bits. I just feel trapped in my own mental prison and I literally can’t believe I’ve gotten to this state. I just wanna enjoy what I used to enjoy, but it feels like even my mind has been chemically, physically and irreversibly changed by all of this shit.

I guess this shit can happen to anyone and it’s honestly the darkest feeling/hole I’ve ever been in in the short 25 years I’ve been here on this earth. The feeling is actually scarier that the thought of death which I didn’t think was possible. I just need to get my thoughts out there because keeping it in is actually getting far too much for me to handle and I can’t handle much nowadays. Perhaps I’ll feel better after writing all of this down and posting it to random strangers on the Internet on my throwaway acc, but for how long idk. Sorry for this wall of text.

Then suddenly got depressed again and now I'm not putting in effort anymore. My grades are pretty shit I might fail the semester. I don't even think I'm capable of graduating at this rate. I'm almost 18 with no job experience. At first it was just about letting myself adjust because I was too nervous and anxious, now it's developed into straight up not giving a shit about it even though I know it's bad. I just can't get myself to do anything. I don't get motivated by other people. I see people I admire and I just think ""wow they're doing so much and they're so cool. They've always been so cool. Even with their mistakes and stuff they still keep going. I REALLY CANT DO THAT IG I COULD NEVER "" and it makes me even more depressed. I'm falling apart and everything around me is falling apart.

I've been rawdogging these thoughts for a little bit because Ive lost everyone I used to be able to talk to about these things. I think I'm being lied to by my friends, I'm not sure if it's just my paranoia but they really just aren't talking to me anymore while hanging out with other people, and I might as well not even be dating my gf anymore because she rarely talks to me due to being busy with school. I'm not mad at them or see it as a betrayal or anything. I'm just sad because everything changes regardless of what happens and I'm left behind due to me being a dumbass and not caring enough. That makes sense. I can't talk to my mom because I'm like an adult baby. I know I'm not even 18 yet but it just feels that way. I can't do anything for her so it's terrible expecting anything from her. I just stay in my room all day and can't manage to do chores. I rather just die but I'd be a huge burden if I died due to expenses and not knowing how to plan it out. All I can do is listen to sad music in my shitty health hazard room and cry in my bed.

I would have frequent episodes at school up until 8th grade mostly, and I lost all my chances at making good friends, was suspended like 6 times, I found out I actually have pretty severe ADHD, now that I mostly have that figured out.. I found out all that time trying to shelter myself from the outside world, has made me extremely depressed, lonely, and I just wish I had someone that understood how I feel.

Everyone I interact with (basically just at work) seems friendly superficially, but whenever I offer to hang out, they just never end up wanting to. I feel like I've done everything I can, but nothing is getting better.",depression,2021-12-07 00:45:15

981,rarz79,im done,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rarz79/im_done/,0,"idk what to do. I always feel so dumb in everything I do and I feel like I'm looked at as just stupid. I have friends I guess well more like ppl who talk to me here n there. I have one really close friend but he has girlfriend so he's mostly worried about her. I really like this one girl too but we can't date because were going to different colleges, same story for me as usual. I've tried dating multiple times but its never worked and my last crush didn't like me at all. I really like this girl because she's the only person or other person I've tried talking to or liked that's said she cared about my happiness , she makes me really happy so her going off to college makes me pretty sad. I know ill sound crazy but I met her a week ago well started talking a week ago I've known her since my 9th grade year (I'm a senior) I actually am in love with her but I can't like tell her that or anything. she likes me back but doesn't want to date but still talk and I think its just a bad idea. the last girl did the same thing with me because I was a sophomore when she was a senior and she talked to a lot of other guys. Ive always felt like a second option and like I'm annoying. I have bad adhd so I tend to over talk or say random things when I feel comfortable with a person or people. I used to be pretty popular I guess my 9th and 10th year but after covid I didn't do half the things I wanted to used to. I just grew up, a lot of people say I fell off and things like that and I see what they mean. my Brian works now I guess idk I used to never think or care now I'm way different. I honestly hate myself and if my old self saw me he'd hate me too. I had thought my highschool life was going to be different then I got into weed. it also changed me, I quit football and just didn't want to do anything anymore I was safe with it. but then it all hit me it changed me so I got my old life back but I still don't like myself I'm not sure what to do. After I got back into my old life and out of depression one of my best friends died and after that I realized nobody was as real as him and I miss him so much, I feel lonely a lot without him I just wish I could open up to someone without me feeling like I'm annoying or thinking I'm weird because he never judged me. I'm really in love with this girl and its hard because college and all but as of late its been more dry and I think she doesn't like me anymore. I had a bit of a thing not a argument but a breakdown and looked like a dumbass, I told her too much too early and just was being crazy over her so now I thin she's scared ill get attached and I think she is distancing herself which breaks my heart but its okay I'm used to this, I just don't really want to date anymore for a long time. I was just worried because at first I wasn't sure if I really like her but we hung n I fell in love. and she let me be me for the first time in forever and it felt so awesome for someone to acknowledge me and finally be with someone and just take care of them I guess. I don't think she likes me anymore though. Im just done with life though I don't have it the worst so I can't complain I'm just tired over the last couple months my dog died, my friend died, I got put on meds, mom caught me smoking, my football season ended early cuz injury, got rejected twice within two months, all my friends talk shit now or only hang to smoke, I'm addicted to weed, me n my dad don't get along because he wasn't here for a lot of my special life events or me growing up. I just want to disappear go somewhere quiet where I don't feel stressed or worried or mad or irritated or feel like I'm annoying and have to tell myself over in my head to not be who I am and be less and talk less I just wish I could tell her all my stuff without her feelings overwhelmed and I wish I wasn't me sometimes. I wish I could trade places with this girls dad and brother so she can be happy because even though she's treating me bad or something I know deep down she's a good person but Its so hard to be happy even when its simple or right in front of you. Im sorry to type so long if u made it all the way down thank you and this wasn't even a qauter if my life but I don't want to type it all I'm sorry thanks bye",depression,2021-12-07 11:15:45

I look in the mirror now and see nothing attractive about myself, whether it’s first thing in the morning or the rare occasion I am dressed up to go out. I have tried changing my hair and new outfits etc but nothing feels the same as it used to. I feel like I’m just faking it and you can tell a mile off.

987,rani15,I thought I was doing better,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rani15/i_thought_i_was_doing_better/,4,"I took my practical final for my first semester in my culinary major. I thought I would do okay, some nervousness was expected. But I messed up and ended up crying the entire time, feeling all my peers watching me and pitying me. The assistant chef even told me to take a moment in the bathroom.
I got an 87 but I’m sure my chef was giving me pity points.

I thought I was getting better. I did my breathing exercises, I tried to distract myself with a small rock I use to ground myself. But nothing worked. But I still broke down. I still had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom. I messed up on making rice. RICE. Out of all things.

Looking back on today I’m just so ashamed of myself for crying in front of everyone. They were just starting to like me, then had to see me like that. At least I don’t have to see them until January now.

I just wish I could disappear. I haven’t because I have a few things keeping me here, but I wish I could just get rid of these bad feelings forever.",depression,2021-12-07 07:12:56

He has owned his own business for most of his life and recently shut it down about 2 years ago. I think this is what triggered it. Then during the pandemic, my parents decided to downgrade their home and sell the house they lived in. A decision that i believe he made in his depressed state. He is super quiet all the time and gets anxiety whenever he is alone. He feels that everyone else at his age is so much further in life. He thinks about the past and is saying that he regrets so many decisions hes made and that he is no where in his life. Just today while he was leaving the house, he goes” what is life??” And walks out the door. I am so worried for him and not sure what are the right things to do or say to make him feel better or what i can do to tell.",depression,2021-12-07 00:19:45

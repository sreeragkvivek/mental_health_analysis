We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,2019-10-29 20:22:02
1,plr86v,Regular check-in post with a note about our reformatted rules,366,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/plr86v/regular_checkin_post_with_a_note_about_our/,882,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

*****

We'd also like to draw your attention to our reformatted rules at  /r/depression/about/rules, which we soft-launched a few months ago.  As part of that, we developed two detailed wikis with lots of reference information.  

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance on how -- and how not -- to offer help and support here.  

YSK that the types of rule violations that cause us the most trouble here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule.  You should never trust *anyone* who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here.  See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact 

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity.  The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.  

* General-interest posts, or posts about causes or issues.  All these are either off topic (rule 1) or activism (rule 10).  

* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts.  This is an expert-free zone -- that's what *peer support* means (rule 5).  We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions.  Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.  

* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses.  Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.  The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression,2021-09-11 00:24:40

Hey so I’ve been going to therapy for some months and tbh I don’t think my therapist is dumb or that she can’t do her job but sometimes I get the feeling that she doesn’t want to admit that she doesn’t have the tools to help me. 
I have both an eating disorder and severe depression, but I’ve learned to deal with the eating disorder, meaning that yeah it’s there but it doesn’t consume all my time and energy like it used to (I’m borderline anorexic, not severely underweight but I still heavily restrict but I don’t starve myself)
depression on the other way is truly eating me alive, in the past few months I’ve been progressively isolating myself and I lost the ability to focus on the simplest things. I’m consumed by the guilt and despair because I feel like I’m not in charge of my thoughts and actions, I wish I had the energy to focus on my passions and my studies but everything that isn’t lying in bed seems too hard and difficult 
And I go to therapy weekly to talk about this, I’ve made it clear to my therapist that I can’t seem to feel better and I desperately need to find a way to recover some energy but she almost always shift the conversation back to my eating disorder or the relationship with my family. Which isn’t what I want to talk about, or what truly is ruining my daily life
She’s very anti psychiatry and anti depressants (in a way i am too since my experience with psychiatrists and meds has been only disappointing: I have taken antidepressants for years and they have never done anything to help my mood or my ED) but I somewhat get the feeling that she doesn’t really know how to truly help me so instead she chooses to focus on what she thinks she can help me with. Am I paranoid or do you think that this can happen: for therapists to be to “prideful” to admit they can’t help one of their patients?",depression,2021-12-06 01:16:19

After any argument I have, no matter how minor & whether it be with parents, friends, or SO, I fall into a depressive hole. Basically until it gets resolved and/or until I get over it. 

For example lately whenever my SO and I argue & can’t come to a resolution I cry nonstop and get depressed until we figure it out. It triggers other parts of my depression & makes me self shame or self hate. This can last for hours or days on end depending on whether we figure it out or both decide to sulk and neither apologizes.


Is this normal? I feel so horrible for putting my SO through this. He gets super down too usually to see me so depressed & he struggles with some form of depression too. I hate it, I wish I wasn’t like this and wish I could control it better. I don’t want to put anyone else through this just because i have depression. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I honestly doubt it. Maybe he would've been an alcoholic because he couldn't find purpose in the world.  
So yea, I wish I could find someone with whom I can share some intimacy and genuine moments, away from all the bs of the world and all the superficiality. Someone who reciprocates trust and love. I sincerely think it would motivate me to be better. I would love to spend lazy evenings in the bed or the couch watching a movie and laugh at silly scenes and debate the movie afterwards, have dinner dates where we cook together, to go outside for walks in nature and parks then sit on a bench or on the grass and talk about life, travel a bit and generally try new activities which are more enjoyable as a pair.

It's manifested itself in fits of rage, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, overwhelming sadness, and long bouts of inaction and laziness. 

I have a hard time maintaining and creating friendships, and while I can chalk some of that up to my own natural introversion and my long-term friends being busy with careers and kids now. But it has become a huge problem that's really getting me down lately.

Background info: At the end of 2020, I moved to California. Honestly, the move was originally to try and kindle a flame in a long-distance relationship, but even after that didn't work out, I was in good spirits. I was proud of myself for making a big decision, doing it myself, driving across the country alone. I loved the weather and lifestyle of the area. My anxiety and depression were generally more at bay than they have ever been.

But, once things weren't going to work out with this person, I knew I had to go. I tried finding affordable places to live in the area, but even roommate situations were just priced out of control. I moved back home, all the way back to the other side of the country. 

At first, I was extremely sad and bitterly disappointed. I quickly put things into perspective by understanding that the important thing was taking the chance and really making a change in my life, even if it didn't work out. I don't regret it. This lifted me for a while, and I was re-connecting with a couple old friends and family. I even started making a couple new friends through my old friends.

But lately, I've seemingly lost the ability to have emotional connections with anyone. Everything feels disturbingly surface level. The woman I moved across the country for and I had a very deep connection. We talked about philosophies, politics, our feelings and emotions, our pasts; we would always talk about really deep things. Here, it feels like I can't get on that level with anyone. I'm afraid to talk about my real feelings with anyone. I don't want anyone to know I'm hurting. I become very disappointed in people, and instead of talking about it, I keep them at arm's length. I'm having a hard time trusting anyone. On my worst days, I feel really alone in the world. I have put these walls up and I'm unsure how to allow them to be broken down.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Advice or something else. It helps me to write it out, either way.

TL;DR having an impossible time connecting with anyone, very sad about it",depression,2021-12-06 08:52:27

They all want you to have an advanced degree, and I barely made it through undergrad by the bare skin of my teeth. Anyway, I stopped pursuing jobs in my field after that Summer because of that along with the fact that looking at a job board online still causes my body to shake, panic, and catastrophize.

The problem is, is that I’m a second year uni student and I’m finding life really hard at the moment. For context, I’m living at home with my family. 

I never really wanted to go to uni to be perfectly honest but after a really good first year I was super motivated to continue at it. My family were really happy as it’s the first time my mental health had seemed okay. So for second year I transferred to a uni closer to home and it’s been horrific. 

I’ve struggled with every single moment - I feel like I physically can’t go into uni without having a panic attack, my hair is falling out from the stress, I’m losing weight and I just don’t feel myself.

To be brutally honest I want to drop out, I’m only in week 11 but I genuinely can’t take it anymore. I have no friends here and my lecturers don’t care and in fact have given me an even harder time. All I want to do is sleep all day and just give up on everything. I’ve tried reporting them but the uni doesn’t care.

Everyone I’ve spoken to has told me that dropping out is an awful idea and that life in an apprenticeship/work would be a waste of the qualifications I have and I would deal even worse with that.

40,r9ywnd,I finally understand why and it scares me.,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9ywnd/i_finally_understand_why_and_it_scares_me/,0,"I am super depressed and did a burst of crying and wished for something in the cosmos to just burn my soul to oblivion. I am hoping typing this out helps me through this. I never really do this. Ill try to do a summery at the top if this gets too long. Emotions are difficult.  The following event has full baring on how I currently feel emotionally. 

To start off my uncle was my mothers brother, both were abused by a very sinister step father growing up. He also probably suffered PTSD when in the Army during Desert Storm 91(Bush Sr. war). My mother, grandmother and him were very close. He was in his early 30's or late 20's

When I was around 10 years old. My uncle committed suicide. He was in the beginning process of my aunt divorcing him. Why she wanted to leave I don't have the answer nor do I desire to know. My grandmother and mom was aware of what was going on and was supporting him the best they could being 4-5 hours away with the communication technology of the mid 90's. We lived in a neighboring state from him and it required long distance or collect calls. A long distance call once a week or a few times a month I am sure happened.  They did not however, have the finances to just pick up the phone and call every day to check up on him. 

I know my grandmother offered to find a new place to live and for him to move in with her and give him what ever he needed. Unfortunately, the one thing he needed was not in her power to give. He knew this and I assumed my grandmother also new this, but tried anyway.

My uncle apparently loved to hunt. It was not odd for him to go hunting by himself once in a while and return a few days later. This probably helped him with any PTSD. He always let people know the general area and how long he would be gone for. He ended up being missing for more than week or close to a week. Again no cell phones, so you cant call a person and check on them and have others try to ultimately put in a missing person request the same day or next day

They put a missing person request to the police and began searching for him. They believe he  probably wanted to be found after commuting suicide. It did not take long to find him when the search began. They had to go in a dens forested area up in the mountains to find him. He was around the area that he told people.

I can remember this day and the days to come. Some parts are more clear than the others. My mother worked as a director for a daycare(s). I usually when to a separate daycare, but for some reason I was at the one she worked at. That day is a blur but I remember two police officers went to the daycare center to let her know a forest ranger found the body. He shot him self in the head. What ever hope she had left her. She broke down and was long time before she was calm enough to go home. She was not expecting that answer.  

I do not remember how long until she broke the news to my grandmother. I know she wanted to do it the best way possible. At that time they found a church they liked and had been going to it for less than a year. My mother and grandmother also participated in a weekly small group bible study. To brake the unfortunate truth my mother went to the senior living apartment my grandmother was living in. For support my mother brought along the small group bible study leader and his wife, an elder/the pastor from the church, my mothers long time friend from high school, me and my older sister. 

In that apartment complex you had to push a button that rang the phone in the owners room. They would push a number and the door would unlock. The activity room the complex had was across the main entrance when you entered. My grandmother was in there and saw my mom and went to let her in. As soon as she put her and on the door to open, she saw everyone else that need to be let in. She did not open the door and refused as she started to cry. I remember her telling every one to go away, nothing bad happened to her son. She stood there and cried for a long time. One of her friends from that activity room had to come over open the door to let us in. We went in and up to her room to give the news. 

I don't remember much after that. All was a blur up to the funeral. I remember not understanding or crying before  any of this or during memorial service. They had two caskets. One that was open with his military picture, and empty military uniform with no body in the foyer. The one with his actual body was in the church service area. I remember there was a handful of speeches and a few songs they played. Men in uniform took the casket and loaded it for transport. I remember a lot of people showed up. They had seating outside. My mom, grandma, and my aunt were sitting up front. A man in uniform  presented two folded up American flag to each my grandmother and aunt while they wept. Then the gun salute went off, a man with bugle played taps and the casket was lowered in the ground. Everyone cried. I cried, but did not understand why. 

My uncle decided to blow his brains out because he was afraid my aunt would take way their three kids from them. As I got older I never understood why he did that and not just see the kids/my cousins when he could from time to time. Even as and adult and having kids my self never understood the decision.   

Right now in this moment I probably understand what he was going in his mind and what he was feeling. I am sure it was not a quick pull of the trigger. I am sure he cried multiple times and may not have gone to actually go through with it. The thought of loosing his kids or only being allowed to see them a few times a week broke him. That constant thought and no viable solution to keep his kids made pulling the trigger easer.

To be clear. After all was said and done. My mom, grandma, aunt and her family have been on very good terms. We still went to visit for thanksgiving and other holidays every year as I grew up. My sister and I also would still visit 2 weeks or a month for summer before the 4th of July. My aunt remarried a very good man with his own kids on shared custody. We had bigger family gatherings and very good memories. 

I unfortunately am driven in a situation where I can not physically see my two kids every day. I have cried multiple times wanting to hold my kids and see them everyday. 

I have the option of being hired with a large well known tech company and be able to afford a descent living and still enjoy what I do, but I cant see my kids every day. My wife refuses to move 4hours way from her parent and family in that small town. I currently make $26 with what I do right now. 

She and the kids live with her mom currently while I try to rent apartment or house.  I have for the past year applied for at least what felt like a few hundred jobs in and around her small town. Two things happen. 95% they don't call for an interview. If they do they don't pay enough. We were struggling when I was making 18/hr and rent was 650/month. To get a place now its almost 1000/month for less then what we had in the same area. I was being offered $12-$14/hr with 10 years of experience in IT. 

I feel trapped in a situation I cant win. I get a good paying job but my wife refuses to move in the city I currently work making 26/hr. I am unable to see my kids everyday.

If I want to see my kids on a daily basis I have to take a job with a deep pay cut and not make enough to rent our own place. We would have to move in with her mom and dad forever. I cant see how that should be a choice. It should be for emergency.

I cant take the kids from her. She is a very good mother to them. I cant just leave them either and move on like its nothing.  

I finely understand why my uncle did what he did. It scares me. The last option is to just end it and be done at this point.",depression,2021-12-06 10:19:26

Lately I feel really stuck in my life, I just turned 21 and I feel like I already messed up. I remember being 17 and having so many ambitions and dreams and I was so driven about my future but I kinda lost controll over everything. After finishing school I took a gap year cause I couldn't decide on what I actually want and felt like I had to figure myself out, which was bullsh*t, I still have no clue. 
During school I always struggled with knowing exactly what I want to study. I wanted to go into something stem related but when I actually had to apply I thought ""What if I'm too dumb, I will probably fail."" So I chose something that I was also interested in, which was English. And I've been studying English for 3 months now and I hate it so much. I can't even explain why but I can't go through with my studies, so I just send the form to drop out at the end of this term. 

I lived in another city for a few months, where I also studied but I've never felt so alone in my life, because of covid we can't go to Uni and it's hard to get to know people. So recently I moved back home. But now I feel like such a looser, I'm 21 and I'm a drop out, so far I haven't achieved anything in my life. 

The worst thing is living here atm, my mom is bipolar and doesn't go to therapy or is taking meds and my dad is just.. i don't know he doesn't really talk to anyone and always minds his own businnes I feel like he is unhappy and wants to leave but can't because he would feel gulity. But at the same time I'm the one that feels gulity because I feel like a burden to my parents. My dad gave me some money for Uni and for my rent and I can't give it back to him cause I don't have a job jet, I really wanna give him that money back, because it was so much and at the end.. it was all for nothing. I just wish I would have made different choices, I feel like I messed up and will never be the person that I always wanted to become. And now I fell down this hole that I can't seem to get out of for the last few months. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, I can't eat or even take showers, I barely sleep anmore and my head feels like its gonna explode any minute.

I've been dealing with depression since 2013 (I was 15 at the time) and by the beginning of 2015 I sough medical help. I finished high school, got into college and graduated by the end of last year. In all those years I went through a lot of shit because of depression and anxiety. By the beginning of 2020 I was actually felling better, I had a job, I was getting close to finishing college, but covid happened, and with it everything crumbled down again. Fast forward to January 2021. I'm unemployed, I had a huge fight with my parents, they haven't really talked to me ever since (we live in a small apartment). The argument was that they simply ignored that covid was still a thing in a country that soon enough 0.6 million people would die because of it. Besides the anxiety/depression thing I also deal with a kidney dessease, asthma and have lost a lot of weight in the past month even though my habits or routine haven't really changed. Besides that I feel like I have been distancing myself of the few friends that I have, and, well they haven't really talked to me either, they all know what I have been through. And well... I feel lonely, I can't really remember the last time someone said ""I love you"" or even gave a hug or something. In the past 4 years I started also cutting myself too when this feeling gets too overwhelming.

I'm dealing with major depression since I was 14 years old.

I was hospitalized because of it when I was 15 years old for one year.
I took prizma for few years, felt numb as f*ck because of it.
Than my life went downhill, I quited prizma after 7 years a started workibg out.
Today I'm 31 years old.
I'm battling depression for 17 years now.
I'm taking serataline daily which helps me to work and function as a normal human being.

My family really never gave a fuck about my depression, and used it against me. 
The lack of empathy from them really drives me crazy, and made me rage on my family members.
It drives me crazy that they think in lying.
My mom even called the cops on me to kick me from the house and my brother didn't treat my cat after she got hit by a car and laught about it when he said it to me.
I had this cat for 13 years or more. She was my life.
And he was like joking about how she died.
I don't know how to deal with it any more.
Every time they cross my mind I wanna sucker punch them the hardest I can. 
I always tried to build myself. I went to the gym none stop for 10 years, got a decent job. 
But still, the lack of empathy from my brother and mom make me so rage and I don't know how to deal with that.
If any one can relate and help me to deal with them i would appreciate it deeply.

I’m so sorry if this is too long, I just needed to vent. I feel so bad for dumping all of my ‘problems’ on my close friends so I’m just gonna dump them here instead. I’m currently in my first year of university and things are not going great for me. Even before uni, I always had low moods and I always felt worthless but now it’s just getting worse. I’ve tried killing myself two times since I’ve been here and thought about suicide weekly if not on the daily. I struggle to make friends and that is probably one of the things that bother me the most. My house mages have already made friends and I feel like I’m just left behind and that I’ll never make friends because I’m extremely unlikeable. People always seem to leave me out and it just makes me think that i’m just invisible. Someone who is clearly worthless and definitely not worth even looking at. On top of that, I liked someone. I confessed my feelings and I got rejected which is fine. It hurt a lot but it’s fine. But this person, after all of this, sexually assaulted me while drunk. I felt so used. I felt like I’m not good enough to be loved, only to be abused and then to be thrown away. And after they did this, they ignored me. I barely got an in person apology which I had to pull out of them. And there’s more. I’m pretty sure this person also likes someone very close to me and they do not try to hide it, not even when I’m with them. It just makes me question myself. Why wasn’t I good enough? What did I ever do wrong to deserve this kind of treatment? I know this all seems very childish but I feel like I have nothing to live for. I feel like I’ll never find someone who’ll love me. Even my mom said that no one will ever love me. I can barely drag myself out of bed. Everything gets worse at night as well. I’ll just cry for hours on top of hours. I’m ugly and worthless compared with other people. I wish I was never born. I’ve waited for things to get better but they never do. My problems seem so childish as well. Like they are not important enough. I feel like I’m only doing this for attention. I just wish I had a better life. I don’t know what I did to deserve this. I’m sorry if this was too long. I also feel like I’m a horrible person. Like everything I do is wrong.",depression,2021-12-06 07:37:42

After a few months my anxiety started to fade, my compulsions got waaaaaay easier to ignore and I have less instructive thoughts. I'm no longer in constant anxiety! But as one layer of emotions was dealt with, another surfaced. Depression and existentialism. And can't stop thinking about death, me dying, my family dying, my friends dying. Sometimes it would present in anxiety about not existing, but now more in depression and lack of motivation. A sort of ""what's the point?"". I can't see a future, not even to next year. I can only think about the end, and the past not the present. I feel sick and had to stay home for a week from school. When I got back I had so much hw (and two essays) that were unfinished. Fast forward two weeks and several extensions later, I still haven't finished my English essay, I've barely started and now I'm also behind on programming. With each day I don't turn it in I get less and less motivated to complete it. Every time I try I end up either just sitting there, writing sometimes useless, or procrastinating with something else. A week ago I had a perfect plan of what to write. Now my mind is foggy and hazy and a can't focus. I don't want to email the teacher because I'm scared of her getting mad and me, she already gave me like 3 extensions. I did meet with my school psychologist which helped a bit but now not so much, maybe I'll meet with her again. Idk I just feel like crying all the time, my chest feels heavy and I can't enjoy myself. At least I finally accepted that I am depressed, instead of labeling it as OCD when that's no longer as relevant. I feel so stuck, I can't write my brain's too full of fog. I just want to lay in bed all day or draw or something. I have so much work besides this and I can't do any of it. I feel so guilty and lazy. My therapist said she might have to prescribe anti-depressants which will hopefully help but that would take about a week to actually get and another 1 to 2 weeks to work from what I researched. Idk I just want to do my work. The panic that comes in when I am too close to a deadline isn't there anymore, I just feel like I'm spectating.

those are the impacts in my life, 2008 my mum died and I still blame me for that, got kicked out by alcoholic dad at 2010, finished then a higher school at 2014 and had feelings for a girl, but she rejected me and said years later she really liked me,  but at that time I had nothing left for her, at 2017 I found a job which satisfied me, then everything went worse, I met a new girl I felt in love with, she cheated on me and broke my heart, a few months later I had an accident in the knee and couldn’t work for 4 months, my boss of the Region then tried to fire me but I choose to take another job offer, the team leader in the new company didn’t liked me at all and at the end they were cutting off 3 months of salary, I then quit the job and chose to do an apprenticeship as a caretaker but I had to move out of my apartment and went to my dad and his gf, both are the worst alcoholics u can imagine, they have spent in 6 months around 15k€ for alcohol. I still search an apartment but this challenge is hard as fuck.

I met up with a girl in my class and found out later she was just playing with me which kind of broke me as well, I then moved on.

Last week I met up with another girl in my class, which surprisingly is the sister of a bro, she told me that a few months ago, we drank and smoked some pot, nothing happened, she said she finds me sympathetic and wouldn’t tell me all that personal stuff if she wouldn’t like me.

I do like her as well and she knows this and that about me, but there is that feeling that every step I do is a step which makes everything even worse, it feels like a reaper sits on my shoulder and he just wants to see me being doomed, I can’t sleep since I moved in here, am being stressed all the time, having crazy nightmares were my mom visits me and so on, I even had suicidal thoughts cause I want to have peace, but I know there is some kind of mission for me, I don’t know exactly what.

At the moment it really feels like I’m being cursed, I changed so much over the years and when we met each other to chill, there came some kind of light out of me, It was the funny and humble guy from the early days, where I used to be smiling all the time, but yet I’m unsure about my next step.

I understand everyone is dealing with their own stuff but the way people interact with me makes me think I'm not important enough to make space for. I try to support people as much as I can within boundaries, but when I ask people to even just check in on me or talk to me on the phone for 15 minutes every couple weeks they may do it one time then never again. 

Like, what is the point? It's been this way my whole life, I'm 30 now so it's probably going to get worse from here. People say they'll be around but when it comes down to it we're on our own. I'm so tired of being so lonely I hurt myself or starve myself or drink too much just to distract myself. 

I can do all the therapy and take all my meds properly but it won't cure the lonliness.

I failing out of uni and my life goes to shit more and more every day. I had a chance for a good life but I messed it up because I feel too exhausted to study or to do just about anything. I lie to my parents about studying while they're working so hard to keep me in this uni. I fucking hate liars and but ironically I turned into one myself. And the funny part is that I worked hard to get here too but then consciously fucked it all up.

Now I just don't care about it. I don't want to study just so I can work myself nearly to death and then dying of a heart attack when I'm 60. I don't feel like it. I don't feel like doing anything. I feel exhausted and useless.

I don't talk to my best friends anymore. Some of them betrayed me, some just don't want to talk to a suicidal person, and the rest of them, who've never done me any wrong, I just fucking ghost. I see their messages asking me where and how am I but I don't answer, I don't even leave it on read. Because I don't feel like talking to them.

And I know, most of people will reasonably say that dropping out of university is not the end of the world. And before you even say it, you know what? Fucking save it for someone else. Maybe it's not the case for you, but for me it was the only opportunity to build something from myself. And yes, I fucked it up consciously, being fully aware of the consequences. YES, I AM AN ASSHOLE, USELESS FUCKING CLOWN. AND I'M SORRY FOR IT, BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN OR WANT TO DO WITH IT.

I talked to many people about suicide including therapist and I swear, I heard every single fucking reason encouraging me NOT to do it. They don't fucking work on me, so just save them for someone more deserving.

It's not even about studying. I want to do it because of the type of person I am. I'm not capable of doing anything even when the conditions are perfect and chances are good. It's not just studying, it's EVERYTHING I DO.

Some will think that I am lazy and just need to get ahold of myself. Whatever, I don't care.

I just want my existence to end. Let it be a gunshot, stab wound, rope, fire, water, asteroid, whatever.

I smoked grams a day and when I saw a pen I’d smoke the whole goddamn thing. I had a problem, but was able to become sober for a while. My sister smokes weed. I just couldn’t help myself but to steal her weed and smoke it. I would steal her used pens and cut up some wire to smoke.

I just came off of having a fun weekend with one of my old friends. We went to a concert and I felt really confident. I had to drive to drop him off today and on the way back I checked in on my Ex who has been having a tough time too right now. We broke up two weeks ago.


The drive home was an hour, so we had time to talk and catch up. But as soon as I got home I felt a sudden emptiness. Its been hard getting along with my roommates (one of which I’ve known for years). I’ve always struggled with being social, and when we first moved in this year I had a hard time with my depression and focusing on work. It took a toll on me so I wasn’t really socializing with my roommates. I just wanted time to myself. It got bad enough to where they’d start talking bad about me behind my back while I’m still there, which made things worse. Its not been fun, I don’t want to move back home, but I don’t have much motivation or desire to move right now. 

My social awkwardness/anxiety/lack of social skills have made it hard for me to make and keep friends. I just don’t feel the desire to talk even though I enjoy a good conversation. Its made it hard to enjoy the things I want to, to maintain relationships and be the person I dreamed I’d be as at 23.

RANTING/ADVICE HELP!
So not by my choice my husband and his dad wanted to buy this place together for us all to live (5 acres). The house has a master bedroom upstairs and small office (which we’re using for two of our girls currently and our son is sleeping in a crib on our room). There is two bedrooms downstairs that they get and is “theirs” (his sister is living in one room (the bigger room) who is “suppose” to move to Utah in 1-2 years so I was told…one of the conditions of okaying me to live here is knowing she will be out). the other room was the parents until they renovated the whole garage which now is done and has a master bedroom, a bedroom for the younger brother, and a loft. Now it’s for us to “borrow” for our girls to use but any guests that ever stay will stay in that room and the kids all back upstairs during that time. Even to borrow, their other son is living in the rv on the property (not a part of the initial deal he’s a druggy and got kicked out of everywhere with no place to go….there is a space behind the small bedroom downstairs that he has inhabited for gaming and doing weed (one of the initial agreements was he can’t smoke weed at all here otherwise he can’t stay. The parents agreed and they already fell through with no backbone). There is a door to the stairs separating the up and down but we can hear everything and they can hear us (no privacy). The dad also took in two cats without asking us to be outdoor to kill the mice on the property (which they don’t) and because I was raised with animals they put on me to take care and feed them without asking because they had no idea what they were doing. 

The conditions I had for living here that I discussed with hubby:
-I get the whole garage to turn into a photography studio for business (they still have their things in it)
-The sister was suppose to move to Utah in a year or two so she wouldn’t be “forever” (now she sounds like she’s changing her tune and never wants to move, get married, or have kids) she is also living here rent free even though she works
-the youngest brother in high school will go on a mission in 4 years and then will be out 
-we would “eventually” get the whole house and the parents would have the renovated garage
***note the druggy brother was never a part of the picture…also living rent free

Here’s why venting:
We just discovered we’re pregnant again that would make us 2 adults plus 4 children under the age of 5 and a dog all upstairs with the one bedroom and one office space (and “maybe” one room downstairs) they heard something that “spooked them” and now the sister is trying to get the druggy brother to stay in the room downstairs just so we can’t (both the two living rent free) nobody knows we are pregnant yet. With this change I think we should get the whole house now. The druggy brother stays in the rv (still rent free and doing his weed which again frustrating the parents didn’t stick to the rules)…he makes our whole house smell like weed which is nauseating being pregnant. The sister can live in the loft upstairs in the garage I’ve seen there is tons of space (the only thing is they have a “storage unit” of stuff still…which the mom is kinda of a hoarder…but again with their space is they have 4 greenhouses too that are empty for storage. We have only hand a room by the heater downstairs same place the druggy brother hangs out.) 

All I want is privacy to let my kids cry it out. My son wakes up every other hour at night because we share a room and senses me so I have to feed him every time and I get high anxiety trying not to wake them downstairs. The two girls sharing that office keep each other awake playing until midnight at least (we put them down 8-9pm) so get cranky during the day from crappy sleep. 

The other factor is hubby’s dad does not take care of himself and has diabetes. Years ago I asked all the siblings one by one their thoughts on their dad and all believed he wouldn’t last until the youngest brothers high school graduation (4 years from now) if he passes my husband would run the family business and we could afford the place by ourselves and buy the mom out….OR he is also an only child and his parents are also going to go soon so EVERYTHING would go to the dad (they live on a 2 acre property) one room the parents and one room for that youngest brother and then we would just sell this place. We looked at all the options before me agreeing to this. 

I told husband that either I would want the whole house or they buy us out of our part/we sell out old duplex we lived in/we buy our own place with the exact 4-5 rooms we would need. According to him his dad can afford this place on his own. Even if we moved he still has the two kids living rent free he could charge or they all move in the house the rent free downstairs and the parents and youngest upstairs and could rent out the garage too….basically there is lots of options. I just want to know ASAP because houses are going fast right now. Hubby insists we are not moving. He said we could turn the walk in closest into a bedroom (that still leaves the girls keeping each other awake and an extra baby) or he said renovate half the garage into a bedroom (one no heating not safe and that takes away the space for my photography studio the whole selling point for me gruntingly okay to move with them. Plus we don’t have the money to renovate the garage to be safe for kids. I also never liked this place because personally upstairs it’s only a shower and my peace for the day every day before was a hot bath to get away from the kids. I have no peace. There are no locks on any of the doors, the heating/ac sucks and is always cold no matter what I adjust it too (the kids refuse a shower so Idk the last time they even have been cleaned…yes disgusting.)They have a bath downstairs but it’s so cluttered down there and again the druggy brother is always down there in the day I don’t feel comfortable having my kids naked anywhere near him. Again “privacy issues”.
They also have a dog they have a crate in their garage (they call the lodge) but all day at work will leave her downstairs in a border thing where she is whining all day while nobody is home again except the druggy brother who barely does anything. I can hear that dog every day.

I guess what I’m looking for in all of this is 
1. Is it wrong for me wanting the whole house being pregnant now running out of space? And just wanting privacy? They are on the downgrade of life and we are going up if that makes sense… who knows if we’ll have more kids in the future and stay cramped with space. (That’s why I’m willing to move)
2. Hubby seems stubborn not to move, I feel trapped and can already feel the depression kicking in and has been mildly since we moved in September and more now being pregnant (I’m terrified/anxious nothing will change…)
3. Is it wrong to assume they should adapt to us in this scenario since we adapted to them bringing in their druggy son…they also gave him a car that he doesn’t have to pay for so he can get to his job. But again pays for nothing.
4. Hubby has told me not to say anything to anyone because it will “spook” them and they will hold on tighter. He said he will “supposedly” talk to them because it’s “politics”….I just find that ridiculous. 

Other backstory hubby and I are high school sweethearts and have now dated 12 years married for 6. In high school his mom would force my guy on dates with other girls to try to break us up because she didn’t like how serious we were (I knew what I wanted in life and I knew he was a great guy worth waiting for) she didn’t even care to try to get to know me and I even joined the church and we’re the only ones of her children who got sealed in the temple like she would want. The oldest sister not here got pregnant 3 times with the same guy and married just because of it (he treats her like crap) their kids are psycho cause trouble irresponsible. Ours are well mannered respectful of people’s things. It seems like no matter how hard I try his family is still selfish and has no respect for me (imagine the cool table in high school and you can’t sit with them or you do and they ignore you…yes it’s literally that ridiculous) they don’t care to engage with me even though I try. It’s like I’m the outsider and expendable to them. Mother in law made a comment during games yesterday which verified that in-laws (those not blood) don’t deserve anything or bare minimum) like how are they members of the church? I just grew up knowing what I wanted and honestly wanted in laws who were like family it was mother in law it was mom and siblings were the same…I’ve accepted that it won’t be that but all I said when moving with hubby was there had to be boundaries and it seems to go out the window with them. Anytime they have an issue big or small they alway call my husband over (last time it was 11pm to get a lizard out of their garage…who cares that they had the two other sons and daughter fully capable) I also asked from my hubby just for the kids to seem him at least 1 hour a day that’s it. He can do whatever he wants otherwise but his family keeps getting in the way of that. All I want is boundaries, privacy, comfort…is that seriously too much of us ask? I feel like hubby won’t cut the chord with them. I keep telling him I’m not saying he can’t see his family but I am saying me and the kids now need to be the priority over them for a healthy marriage. Am I crazy? Ugh again I feel trapped, depressed, and nobody talk to. Idk what to do…if you read all this god bless you I really just needed to be heard by someone.",depression,2021-12-06 08:28:58

Thats where I confuse myself, sometimes I dont know if I'm actually feeling okay or if I'm so used to wanting to look fine its just an automatic reaction. I've always felt unconfortable showing or telling others something is wrong or sharing my feelings in general, mostly because I don't want to worry anyone.

I created this account because I wanted to get this out of my system. I'm your average bratty teen who's currently undergoing her daily dose of ""i have no idea what the fuck is going on"". Right now, I have no idea what I'm feeling. Am I being dramatic? Spoiled maybe? I feel like I've been showered with love but it seems lacking. I feel disconnected from my family. I feel as if I am being shut down or unheard. I have mood swings. I'm irritable. I feel as if I cannot reach out to anyone because it's been drilled into my mind that no one gives a shit. I can't even take it upon myself to give a shit about other people, so why should they? I'm a horrible person. But I still blame others. Crazy right? I don't have any goals in life. I'm just living for the sake of living. Everyday I just do the same things. Nothing new. Nothing to look forward to. The small things I used to hang on to which gave meaning to my life are slowly fading away. But I have no courage to do any physical harm to myself. I feel like I don't have the right to vent or rant or think that I have a problem if I don't go to the extremes. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. Am I the one in the wrong for thinking this way? I feel like I'm just creating more problems for myself. I feel like everything's been given to me but I still have a way of finding the bad in it. I'm mad. Mad at myself. Mad at everyone who has made me feel this way. I feel like a spoiled brat for thinking that I should be heard. I feel spoiled to think that my feelings should be valid -- to think that I am worthy of asking for more. I feel bad for the people that would read this, as if I'm just creating more problems for others. I feel bad for all of you who have been inconvenienced with my feelings that I have written on this post. I feel sorry for wanting to be heard. So many feelings are stirring within me but I feel too guilty to call it a problem. But at the same time, I want to be labelled with some form of illness just to be heard. ""Depression"". I don't think I have it. I don't want to think I have it. I feel guilty to even wish to have it. But at the same time I think, ""if i had this, would my feelings become more valid? Would I finally be heard? If these feelings within me could be labelled, would I be worthy of something more?"" But I know that's inconsiderate to those actually struggling. I don't know anymore. Reading back on this, I question if I'm being manipulative. Trying to manipulate all of you to have pity on me. Trying to manipulate all of you to think I'm pathetic and in need of help. As if crying for sympathy because I lack attention and didn't get my way in life. I feel like a horrible person. Ungrateful. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel like my way of thinking is wrong. Am I wrong? Is this even a question of right and wrong? I don't know. I can't shake the feeling that I am wrong, and that someone is laughing at this post thinking I'm being ridiculous. I've always had that fear which is why I've been fearful of asking for help. Now, I am finally doing it. Now, I have gathered the courage to put what I am feeling into words. If anyone can give insight on this, please do. Simple comfort or words of encouragement would be much appreciated. :)",depression,2021-12-06 07:43:25

94,r9veqs,"I am transgender, and I am losing hope.",2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9veqs/i_am_transgender_and_i_am_losing_hope/,1,"Hey all. I'm illy, I've been actively transitioning medically for just about 2 years now, my first dose of spiro and estrogen were on Dec. 21st 2019. I've been struggling for months or years beyond with suicidal thoughts, and I am so concerned that I am getting closer to the edge.

A bit about me, I have lived a pretty rough life. I grew up in a broken family, just like so many other kids, and one with a highly queerphobic father. He used to tell me stories about how proud he was growing up in the 60's beating up gay folk for being gay. We never had a lot of money for things that we wanted, we had a lot of things that HE wanted, like the hockey gear that he bought so that he could make me be a goaltender, but when it came to pursuing my own interests it was always short on change. Growing up was rough, we moved every few years so he could dodge his income taxes a bit longer. I never really set down roots or understood how to make a lasting friend.

I didn't know I was trans for a really really long time. I was 26 (Late 2016) when I first started questioning why I never felt like I looked right, and through various throwaways and therapy I came to my ultimate conclusion. By this point I had already gotten with the person I thought I was going to be with forever, and we had a lovely little family with two children that I was providing for. One hers, and one ours. Revealing that I am who I am, and how I am, broke our family. Within a year or so, our relationship fell apart, she split (late 2017, early 2018) and separated me from the eldest child who I had raised from birth with her, as he went to live with his other biological parent. I was left, alone, with my girl and my grief. When I think back, this is the moment I never seem to be able to get over. Therapy helped stem the bleeding, but I've never really healed. How could I when I've lost a child? For a while I managed to keep it together and kept working my job, I was in a really well paying secure position with an aluminum smelter, but my anxiety at not being my authentic self drove me to leave both that position and my hometown in attempt to pursue my truth.

The intervening years, barring my transition, have been hell. I left my hometown in April of 2019, and by the end of November of 2019 I was finding myself in a position where I wasn't going to be able to comfortably or even basically provide for my daughter. At that time my ex had moved on and moved together to the city we were living in with her new partner, and they were in a financial / life position that was going to be better for the wee one. I made the decision at that time to send my girl to live with her mother, so that I could get back on my feet and get my transition stuff started. I needed to live authentically. Well. Covid happened. I wasn't able to find work for approximately 18 months during the pandemic, stuff having been shut down as it was and leading into my inability to work positions similar to what I had worked up to at that point in my life, I was stuck. During this period of my life, being down without my children, without my love, starving and clinging desperately to the fact that ""at least I was medically transitioning"" has probably been the hardest of my life. I seriously contemplated my death a few times during this period, I even called the suicide hotline a couple times and I was left on hold. My best friend pulled me out of my rut during this period a few times just enough to dust me off and keep me moving, even just a little. During this period I have been also waiting on surgical assessments for my bottom surgery, since in Canada (specifically BC) we have a lengthy waiting process in order to qualify for covered gender affirming surgeries.

Then, an opportunity. I got a call for a job offer in a new sector back in my home town, at a good rate of pay with lots of overtime opportunity. I finally felt like maybe the cards were turning around at this point. Maybe, just maybe, I could get back home and put my hustle back on so I could prepare a place to have my girl home with me again. I finally got the paperwork and assessments put through so I could go for my surgery. I finally think, ""here we are, we did it, it's all coming together"".

I just got the news that it's going to be several more months to years of waiting before I am likely to get in for my surgery. I found out that my income vs debt won't allow me to get any form of mortgage. Rentals are far, far too expensive for any single income to afford here. I just faced down a brutal abuse by a guy I thought was going to be my partner, he led me on for months until we finally were intimate, just to turn around and say ""I want this to be a secret, I have a woman I am interested in making my wife and I don't want anything to mess that up."" I made an impulsive decision to order a bunch of computer parts for a much needed upgrade, and the delays on the shipping on them all have me so beyond hope they will ever actually show up that it feels like I just spent $1500 for nothing.

I am drowning. I am suffocating. I am back in this small northern BC town away from my best friend in this world, I still don't have my daughter home, I don't know that I ever will, and I feel so hopeless. I no longer want to live. I don't want to die, I could never do that to my baby, but I do not want to live. I am constantly hounded by my ever present gender dysphoria. I need my surgery to help, I want to feel right, and nothing is working out. I have no family support. I am scared that I am going to finally break through that final line and just end it all. That thought terrifies me because I don't know how much more of this life I can take, before the thought of hurting my girl by hurting myself is no longer enough to keep me here. I need help, and it feels like nobody can help me.",depression,2021-12-06 07:19:53

I really never cry, the only times I cry is when I watch  some random show to bear with my boredom and realize I'm about to finish it.

Currently I live with my parents and I just got a job working in IT. I don't take any anti-depressants cause I've had horrible results with all the ones I've tried, so I do my best to keep it under control by exercising, playing music, and trying to socialize with people (atm I have no friends). Smoking weed helps as well. Usually I can fake being happy, but inevitably I always break down because I get tired of faking it.

I've tried so many different methods to get this shit under control from therapy, anti-depressants, support groups, meditation, yoga etc. It seems no matter what I do, in the end I feel hopeless, worthless, and discontent. 

I hate crying myself to sleep every night because I feel completely alone, I hate trying to fake my happiness so my family doesn't worry about me, I hate the fact that I can't make enough money to afford my own place, I hate how I can never make a relationship work because of my problems, I hate how other peoples lives seem fulfilling and joyful while I always seem to be suffering. I try to make friends and meet people but ultimately I choose to be alone anyway because it's easier. I always have compulsive, really negative thoughts about myself that cause me to break down, and I don't want to be around people when I can barely keep it together.

I can't do that. I don't even know what frame to draw after what frame. I've made like, 100 animations but they look horrible.

I tried writing, I'm precise with details and so that the story makes sense. But of course, skill doesn't matter if literally not a single person gives a crap about your 1-2 year long, well-thought of original story.

I tried getting good or recognized at some of my favourite pc games, I'll just say one thing, huge mistake, I still suck, and nobody knows who I am even though the games I play have pretty small communities.

I tried singing, practices two songs for 5 months and I still sound like someone was vomiting and screaming at the same time while sitting in a old rusty dumpster in the middle of a thunderstorm 

I tried youtube. Oh god no, I don't even know how to add music to videos or how to add text. 

I tried learning how to use the piano, oh wait. I don't have a piano, only a random piano phone app that constanly gives you ads and is either too badly done or too complicated or requires you to have a actual piano 

Worst of all, I just can't get encouragement to continue doing any of these if I show my art to some people and they completly ignore it or just say ""cool"" and move on, this applies to everything else! I'm just always ignored. Guess this is my fate, also if you are reading this, DAMN you're lucky because the chances of my post getting red are probably smaller than the chances of me winning the lottery by this point. I can't focus on ""training"" one skill because if I do, guess what, I realize that I suck, I give up and get depressed then go rant on about it on a over lengthy reddit post that'll get buried either way.

Lost all my friends after having to medically withdraw. Got into a relationship that introduced me to drugs. Had to go to residential treatment for my ED (not helpful). Came back, broke up with my BF when covid hit. Developed vertigo, migraines, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. Both of my grandpas died. One of them had a stroke, heart attack, and dementia.

Life has no purpose but to inflict pain. Nothing but pain. Endless pain that doesn’t stop but more pain will come until life ends. I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m ready to end all this pain. I’m sick of everything, sick of “for what.” I’m living this awful life because I’m forced to. I don’t want to be forced anymore. My mind has been decided, I end my own life at some point. When? I don’t know. I’d rather it be soon to make it all stop but I don’t think that will be feasible. Simply put, for what reason am I still here. The name ______ _____ is a name that haunts me, a name that pains me to think of. I no longer feel joy or hope when I think of this name. I only feel pain and endless “whys?” How can something so exciting and hopeful change in a matter of minutes. How can something be wrecked so quickly that no matter the length of time you take to fix it, it’ll never be repaired. I need help but I don’t know how to obtain it. All I know is that I need it. I’m writing this for what? You see, for what is one of the most contradictory statements you can say or think of. That’s all I think of anymore, “for what.” I write this in a matter of minutes in an attempt to relieve this agony. Does it help? Not sure at this moment. My eyes, they see so much, they see nothing but things that I wish I had. Things of happiness, wealth, and pure bliss. Why is it that a free thing is so hard to obtain? Why is happiness one of the easiest things to find but you can’t easily achieve it? I have not felt pure happiness in what feels like forever. But granted, I slowly lose track of time. Time runs through my hands like the statement “for what” runs through my head. I’ve heard from countless people that high school is the best years of your life but why is it my worst years? Why does everything turn out the way it does? I’m only 16 and I’ve already realized how unfair and rigged life is. Some people are lucky and just become happy without doing anything. I try to do everything in my power to achieve this happiness but I can’t ever grasp it. They say once you hit rock bottom the only way to go is up but if that’s true, then why have I been stuck for so long? I do so much for others but what do I get in return? Nothing. For what do I do this. For what do I live. I write this before a Monday, a truly horrid day.

First my father didn’t want me(in my home country, having a girl child was frowned upon) and my mum became a single mother. She tried her best to give me a good life, but our relationship was always turbulent. We regularly fought in my childhood, sometimes physical. I was a fat kid, often bullied. 

Then I met the love of my life in grad school, we were engaged and one day, he told me he wants to break up. Those few months after the broken engagement, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. Then I married this other man and came to the US, turns out he was cheating(sexting and sending nudes) all along, found it out on the day of our first wedding anniversary. He was sorry! I went to a session of therapy because I was all alone and wanted to vent, the therapist was sweet but it didn’t really help me though. Husband and I regularly fight over stuff, had to call 911 a few times. Neighbors have called 911 on us.

i'm (35m) unhappy and have been for as long as i can remember.

i set goals and give up on them, i don't really have any hobbies or interests, no real friends, etc

i'm terribly uncomfortable talking to most people and especially the opposite sex. i really don't feel like i have anything to say and i'm not so sure i'm interested in hearing what others have to say either.

people tell me i should get a dog, pretty sure that's just their way of telling me to shut up. 

or maybe that they agree that i'm not going to find the acceptance that i'm seeking from other humans

i feel so inadequate all the time. i almost always look at other guys as competition, why would anyone want to be with me when they could be with one of them instead? etc

as far as looks go, i'm average at best but the situation probably isn't hopeless. i have some nice facial features that could do a lot more for me if i would just develop my body a bit, 

but it's not going to happen. i'm supposed to be working out right now but i'm doing this instead.

even if i do work out right now, it's not going to make a difference unless i keep doing it consistently forever and ever and i just won't

but what i'm trying to say is that i'm not much of a ladies man and don't see that changing

i used to draw a lot or whatever. they weren't bad, i made little comics and cartoons and things and i think people were genuinely impressed by some of them.

that was supposed to be my thing. 

but do you have any idea how hard it is to sit down and do a thing? it just feels like work and i obviously don't enjoy working

it doesn't seem like my problems can be solved without medication, all of which have shitty side effects that would only create new problems anyway and i just don't see any way through this

i'm in love with someone. we dated briefly and it was pretty bad. they themselves are no prize, a hopeless drug addict and not a very caring person overall.

this person makes me feel used and never acknowledges my feelings. i try to cut them out but months go by and sooner or later i end up feeling so low that even talking to them again seems like all upside from where i'm at. this has gone on for a few years now

i'm doing better financially than i ever have. but i don't like my job, most of the people i'm surrounded by, or the amount of hours i work in a week to sustain it all. 

i have nicer things now than i ever thought i'd have but it doesn't really change how i feel. i also don't want to downgrade my lifestyle for some reason

i'd like to share my life with someone. the problem is i'm too insecure to even let that happen, even if anyone wanted to share a life with me. 

i actually compete with the women that i date and feel threatened by their own successes, it's really pathetic. you could describe me as a fuckboy and i wouldn't be able to defend myself

this doesn't happen very often anyway because i am mostly alone

i'm also concerned that if i fell in love with someone, i might get bored and fall out of love and disappoint them. maybe life is just boring

i recently hooked up with a 22-year-old. she seemed to enjoy the sex and my company.

she is very nice and kind of cute, though truthfully, i'm so superficial that i wouldn't even brag about her or want to introduce her to anyone i know. 

she's also a little too enthusiastic and, honestly, kind of annoying

i'm pretty sure that if i met someone that i thought was really cool, it wouldn't matter if they were really pretty or just ""kind of cute,"" but that's not the case with this girl either way

when the sex is over, i just want to be alone again. this isn't a new thing for me

obviously, i'm not a very good guy or anything. but i honestly don't think i'm that bad, either. i'm mostly just weak, and weakness can bring out the worst in people, i think

i just don't know what to do about any of these feelings or the hopelessness of my situation. i think about suicide all the time but honestly do not consider myself to be suicidal.

as afraid as i am of my life never changing and just getting worse as i continue to age, i'm also very afraid of dying. maybe this will change as the situation worsens, but we're not there yet

i just want someone to talk to about all this, but i want the conversation to be different from the ones i've had in the past. i don't know what i want really

He laid in bed. Hard thoughts knocked down every good urge to wake up and do something. The face of a beautiful girl shined like the moon on a crisp winter night. The moon turned red when he opened his eyes to see the room so bleak. “How did it get to this?”, he asked himself. Give me love, give me peace, torment me no longer with thoughts of what could have been. Lie to me not about what it still can be. The moon is red with my own blood, I’ve broken my fate and fell into my own abyss. I’d die to escape, if I believed that death was an escape. The walls are growing smaller with every breath. Where is god now? 

A tear came to his eye. Like from a fountain of youth, the stress in his face eased, replaced with a plea. “My god, restore my mind to be like the comfort in the sun. Give my hands over to purpose, a life lived to diminish this pain. I see no other path, all others have led to pain and hardship. I can’t go on like this.” 

The tear dried up before it could crash. He lied motionless in bed. With the tear gone, like the rain clouds evaporated by the heat, the sands of the desert came to rule. Rustling over hills of itself, sliding down steep drops, turning with the gusts of the wind, a terror drew in from the deep. A terror saying “this is your eternity. No one to love, no life to give. None to have.” 

To get out of the sand, he sat up and got out of bed to get his day started. “There is still time. I can make it to a land of rolling hills.”",depression,2021-12-06 08:38:14

I have hated my life for a long time - started when I was 12 and now I’m 19. But I was always sane throughout, I rarely seriously contemplated suicide and was always able to somehow do the things I had to do, even though I always pushed them back until the last minute or just skipped stuff that wasn’t too important, I was always able to just barely scrape by. So I just crave a moment where I just completely lose control, where everything goes wrong, where my mind won’t be able to keep up and I just breakdown and show it all. I have done everything I can to provoke this (sometimes consciously; sometimes unconsciously) I had insane drug benders to cope with my feelings, I took LSD when I was feeling bad in hopes of a bad trip - yet I never broke down and never got an explanation or a reasoning for why I was always feeling this way. Everytime I get a glimpse of happiness it always seems to get destroyed by outside sources or even by me and simply because of how I am (which i just can’t entirely change).
Honestly I just want to be happy and I’m doing a lot of things to support that, like working out regularly, eating healthy, going outside and seeing and experiencing new things. - yet no matter how many „positive things“ I do I always go back to feeling this way, sometimes after a slight setback and sometimes just out of nowhere. Even going to a therapist for several months didn’t help and I just don’t feel like doing this anymore - I wouldn’t commit suicide, but I just want to give up and stay in bed, smoke weed get drunk and forget about everything again and make it easy on myself - I get that life isn’t supposed to be easy but it simply has been hard for too long and I just need a break, I just want to be happy for once, I just want to feel genuine joy, I just want to feel loved for once…

so i have taken many online tests (including the official NHS one, which is for over 18s and i am under so that’s saying something) which have all come out with the same result: i have moderate to severe depression. i know it too i’ve lost interest in things, don’t want to socialise anymore, get really teary and snap at people often, hopeless, tired as if i had an all nighter even if i had a 12 hour sleep, constant muscle and joint pain and etc. and i’ve told no one apart from maybe a couple months ago when i didn’t look into it too much i told my friends saying i might have depression and they didn’t really care. I feel the need for help so i went to my school counsellor and they advised me to some program thingy, but the amount of times i’ve hinted without saying it that i have depression, because i am self diagnosed even though i have all the symptoms not including lack of apitite, and they either choose to ignore it or don’t understand. Imagine, a 13 year old walks into your office saying they’re self diagnosed with depression. no one will believe me. my parents broke up not too long ago, covid and all that, i have never had a stable friendship and more toxic friends than you can count so the reason is pretty self explanatory. i don’t know what to do because i know i need treatment but i feel like no one will believe me. another thing is that i do not remember what it feels like to be genuinely happy. if you ask the people i know they will say i’m the happiest person they know but this is because i always have a fake smile on. now i can’t cry properly when i have the chance because i’ve trained myself to be able to cry without making any sound and holding back. i have suicidal and self harming thoughts that wonder into my mind a lot; i never want to go through with them but the fact remains that they are there.

165,r9rozp,Need some help,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9rozp/need_some_help/,3,"Everyone…I really need your help. I’ve never been the one to turn to the internet and random people for reassurance or advice, but I’m in a really low spot.

I’ve read almost every single thing about suicide at this point. The devastation it causes to loved ones, the permanence of an unthinkable action. And even though there are days where I feel so depressed that I sometimes wish I wasn’t alive anymore, I could never EVER go through with an action that would hurt those around me.

That’s the problem, you see I’m very aware of my actions. Im very aware that I have a family who loves me dearly and would do anything for me. I’ve voiced my depression and anxiety to them for years and have been very transparent. I’ve seen about 8 different psychiatrists, therapists, psychologist and social workers and nothing has helped. I’ve read self help books. I’ve tried multiple SSRI’s and antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and ADHD meds (all of which had no reaction or made my condition worse…aka the worst depression I’ve ever felt). I’ve worked out consistently and made dietary changes. 

I’ve done so much and I know deep down is that any self-help needs me to stay diligent but I never put the work in (which can be blamed a lot on my diagnosed ADHD). Part of my depression is that I always feel lazy. I slack off at work, yet still continuously get promoted. I never do things if they’re too hard, I always try to find a shortcut.

I hate that I need to have things a certain way or obsess over thoughts and consequences of my actions (I also have diagnosed OCD).

Truth be told, I just hate myself more and more. I was bullied for years growing up, I didn’t have many friends until I went to college. Then I had a bunch and a girlfriend for a few years. When I left college I had made new friends and kept some. Now Ive lived in a new state for a couple years, have hardly made friends with anyone despite joining clubs, sports teams, work outings and so forth. 

I’m extremely social, I used to have no anxiety about conversation with total strangers and now, for the first time ever, I’m more and more nervous. I can’t meet a girl for the life of me. Every time I do, they end up being an alcoholic, manipulative or don’t have enough in common with me.

I just feel lost. I’m not happy anymore, at least not with any normal consistency like I used to have. I don’t want to continue, but suicide isn’t an option. I try to do things for myself all the time. I treat myself to things, like vacations and such. But I take them alone, so I feel like shit when I’m on them.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Prescriptions are no longer an option in my book (too many bad experiences and I’ve seen pharmaceuticals wreck havoc in my family). I’ve tried multiple holistic things too like ashwaghanda, and others to no avail. I have no motivation to see another counselor, or keep up with things like CBT.

I know this just feels like a rambling vent…and for any who have made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to a stranger. Quite frankly, I’m not sure I even know what I’m looking for by posting this. But I needed to say something because I’m hurting so much inside.",depression,2021-12-06 04:18:12

Of course, I would still have a guilty conscience about it- guilt is a pretty strong factor for me, and it made me want to live up to expetations placed by my parents. I graduated high school, graduated with my bachelors', and now I'm here.

I don't know what to do. I have a job which does not pay well and is not in my desired field, I am living with family, and I have no motivation to do anything, just like always. I can't even bring myself to brush my teeth and shower. I can't bring myself to do chores or talk to my family or work on myself. My family all know there's something going on with me, and they tell me to get a therapist or do something and I just cant bring myself to. I will schedule therapy appointments and miss them. Repeatedly. So I stopped going. Now I'm just sinking into nothingness. I only do things which bring me short term comfort, because that's all I can bare. All I manage to do is go online, and pretend I don't exist for a while, or hang out with my friends and pretend like we're still in high school and nothing has changed, like we're still just kids.

\--

I can't remember a time before this. A time when I did things enthusiastically. A time when I felt joy, free of guilt, free of the thought that all this is false. A time when I wasn't afraid to live my life and make mistakes and try again. I can't remember who I used to be.",depression,2021-12-06 07:38:55

My seizures cause my right leg to jerk forward and sometimes extend out while shaking so I have to sit down for my safety. I call the ones that make my leg shake and cause me to make noises my bad seizures because sometimes I experience pain during them and they can last around 5 minutes. The small ones just make my leg jerk forward and only last thirty seconds. I just don’t have the confidence to go in public because I am afraid of attracting attention from bystanders with my seizures as I don’t like being looked at with pity during them.

My team and I recently launched a nonprofit in the US focused on **addressing male hesitancy to mental healthcare through golf**. The organization essentially organizes scramble-style outings for our participants (we call them 'members') and embeds therapist/psychiatrist-curated group exercises in each foursome to introduce the golfers to the style in which therapy is presented and used (e.g., 18-questions for the group, one per hole, increasing in how personal or sensitive the topic is hole-to-hole). After the round, should any member have found benefit from the exercises, we have local therapy practices on hand to answer additional questions (or simply hear about how the round went, they're great listeners).

The **most important aspect to make this successful is the members themselves** \- if you, or anyone you know, may be interested - please give [**scramblegolfclub.com**](https://scramblegolfclub.com/) a visit and fill out the contact form ([https://www.scramblegolfclub.com/contact](https://www.scramblegolfclub.com/contact))! We'll be organizing outgoings via clusters of zip codes so the more folks in your area, the greater likelihood one of the first outings will be a town near you. Unfortunately we’re only focusing on the US for the time being but hope to eventually have chapters abroad as well.

Separately - appreciate any and all thoughts and feedback. We're a small team and value any help and advice!

(sorry for my not perfect english)
Except if you are religious and your goal is to go to heaven/not go to hell. I really do not see any point of pleasure, since any pleasure is limited in time. Which doesn't mean i want to suffer, i still enjoy a nice meal for example, just not as much as if it had a point. A lot of people tell me the point is to have as much positive emotions as possible, which will make your life go faster, and your inevitable death come unnoticed. But to me, happy or sad, the end will be same. Every time i think of it, i start crying. No matter what you do, you will die, and death is scary. I really want to believe god exists, that my life serves some purpose, but i am not into lying to myself. When i talk to people about my thoughts, most if them aknowledge life is useless but they do not have a problem with it, in fact they don't even think about it. How do they do?
Has someone ever been like me then got better, and what helped? Is religion the only way?

Rant, I'm sorry:

Things were nice lately. I met my aunt and her husband, people I never saw in my 21 years old life because of my abusive mother, but now that I left, my older brother (30) present them to me. I spend two weekends with them, they were so nice and loving, and they understand more than my brother (who is really uncomfortable with comforting me). I haven't felt so happy in a long time, even if I still wasn't cure.

However, tuesday, after I went into an argument with my sister (19), my aunt decides to trauma dump on me, probably to relate. But it was not helpful at all. She told me her husband is cheating on her, blames it on her, insults her, and she was considering k\*\*\*ing herself because she was so alone (she's seventy-ish years old and couldn't have children) until I came into her life. Now, she sends me messages about how I'm her only reason to be alive, calls me crying when she gets into an argument with her husband, tell me about how she miss me being at their place because he's nicer... It's a lot for me.

Even my sister-in-law told me she hopes I was going to save their couple. But I'm trying to heal, I cannot be an emotional support... Also, I was already ""responsible"" of my parents' mental health when I was home, of my sister until I cut contact (they were guilting me to do stuff by threatening to k\*\*\* themselves...)

So my good mood is ruin. I have nobody to talk to because my brother is not really understanding and so uncomfortable, I don't want to annoy him with my issues, and my aunt tells me about how I'm her only reason to live or show me annoying post like ""Choose to be happy for your health""... I'm actually at my aunt's place because we planned it before all of this happened, and with the holidays, I don't know where I'm going to go. The mood here is totally different now that I know (and they got into an argument before I arrived) but my brother keep pushing me to get a job (I can't with my actual mental health, it's impossible, but he doesn't understand) and I was really unhappy when I was living with him, and none of them will let me alone at my place (and it would not be good for my mental health)",depression,2021-12-05 23:00:18

I'll never be comfortable being a women. I tried to convince myself I hated it for simply gender roles and objectification. It didn't work, they were all lies and fake.

I'll never be happy with my body. Even if I transition fully, I'll never feel correct. I'll always be wrong and broken. I'll always have scars that I have look at in the mirror. Features of what estrogen damaged that I can't fix. My hips are almost/all bone, they'll never be as slim as they should have been. I look at transition photos and the hips still look too wide. My hands, feet, and arms will never be big. I'll never be even close to the average man's height. I could care less about dating issues, that's the least of my concerns. 

Sure, some might say, many men have those features and they're cis. Yes, they might, but at least theirs was due to simply *bad luck*, they simply got the shit end of the stick. I'm biologically female, I got those features because of *that*, not shit luck and chances are, most don't have the *majority* of those features at the same fucking time. That is what fucking hurts.

My skeleton will always be female. I'll have to live with the knowledge that *thing* is in me, no matter how much I want to just tear it out. I'll have jab myself with a needle, apply gel, or something else for the rest of my life, not have it happen naturally. I'll never have XY chromosomes. My parents will never love me and would disown me. I don't blame them, they already have a real son, I'm second class.

I don't understand. Every. single. one. of my guy relatives and friends get to be male. They get to go through the right puberty naturally. Except me. Why was I born wrong? I think of the life I would've had if I was right. Everything would have been right and I should have been him. I'll start to form tears even if I simply imagine to hear ""its a boy!', seeing him going through puberty like every other guy, or imagine that little boy with his family.

I just wish this was a terrible nightmare or I'm in a coma relieving my life as a girl, and when I wake up I'll see my family relieved and asking if their son/grandson/nephew is okay.

I don't want to die but I don't want to live either. I don't think I could bear the idea of living and never being him. Trans people say you'll eventually accept you'll never be cis and will be happy with your transition, but that isn't an option for me. I could have been happy, but it was taken away from me the second I got a second X chromosome and my fate was sealed. I'm already a dead man walking. I just want the dysphoria and pain to end. I want to drink, maybe myself to death, but I can't because I'm underage. I can't even do that.

Turns out he likes me as a friend but says we have a connection and romantic compatibility. He apparently thinks I’m toxic and demanding for wanting more from him when he  claims he wants to stick to having a hoe phase but I was convinced he liked me and he said so himself he said I was worthy to him. I feel so gaslighted and confused. He would Call me names like baby and queen and whole other set of things. At first I thought it was nothing personal that he just wasn’t looking for it with anyone. But now it’s an attack on my character,” I’m always so sad and negative.” He mentioned he didnt like that I mentioned the kardashians?! Like is he crazy? He says different things and next twists them. It’s absolutely crazy making. Now I lost all my friends Bc or him Bc they know him. Please help",depression,2021-12-05 11:48:31

I became a doctor because of social pressure. I never wanted to. But everyone in my family wanted me to go in medical. Everyone was convincing me all the time that I can't achieve anything in physics/engineering that I actually liked. 
I was always a distinction holder and I got a seat on merit and then became a doctor. 
I felt like my brain melted away, reading all the anatomy and memorizing all of the stuff instead of actually using my brain to study maths and physics that I loved. I later destroyed my life even more when I joined Paediatrics for specialization. I was bullied by seniors, harassed by male colleagues, had to do 80-100 hours at least per week including 30 hour duties every third day in addition to 6 hour fixed duty daily. I had to see sick kids, dying kids, suffering families, lack of resources and incompetent seniors not doing anything for the poor patients (and just bullying and abusing us). 
Cherry on top I lost 2 pregnancies, and lost my newborn baby at 1 month age. I blame all the stress of the work for it. As my autoimmune profile is normal. 
At the age of 29, in 3rd year of my specialization I am sick of it. I am done with it. I cry often and I regret being a doctor. I hate sickness and death and I don't want to treat patients any more. I don't want to attend calls and reply to texts of relatives asking me for free prescriptions for their kid's ailments. I am sick sick sick. I want to die now. 
What should I do now? Can I start over ? 
Can I save my remaining mental health? Or should I just go on? 
Should I commit career suicide after all this ?

I have been so easily frustrated today. I liken it to my autistic toddle nephew getting frustrated and overwhelmed by literally everything.  Want to hide in the covers?  You have to move them to cover you to keep warm, which is just too much. That kind of thing.

I used to think it was some form of meditation I was inadvertently doing, but I am not concentrating, I am not focusing, it just sort of instantly turns things off for me.

also my dad came home and started yelling at me and belittling me abt something i didn’t have anything to do with and didn’t even want to happen. and he raises his voice into a angry serious tone, and not a tone of voice of a dad but the tone of voice of an angry boss getting frustrated with a worker or something.

and he acts like he only wants to be helpful to me but he always yells at me like it’s my fault whenever i cause him any slight inconvenience. 

whenever u tell him he was getting angry or yelling at u he will deny it always. i just wanna kms if life will always be this hard and if i will always be hurt and misunderstood by people like my parents.

I was unemployed in that time but quickly found a job at a milk plant and struggled to adapt to the new situation but still managed to get through it with my gf. About six months into my new job she lost hers and I invited her to work with me at the milk plant since we have similar work backgrounds. We were on the same shift car pooling spending time together and it was stressful in more ways than one but still we made it work. Another 4 months go by and my gf invites her best friend to work with us as well and she practically lived with us for the next year we all worked together at the same place while I tried to maintain it all I felt overworked and streched thin trying to keep my relationship stable while helping our mutual friend and struggling to keep a good work ethic. 

It was hard through it all but finally my gfs friend got her own car and it was just us again at the start of 2020 but by that time I noticed my gfs behavior was different. Always on the phone with someone who was listed in her contacts with a nickname. I didint think much of it as I was trying to get promoted to make more money but it all really came clear when my gf wanted to go see some old friends one weekend and no matter how much I asked she refused to give any real details. I was always open with her never hiding anything and letting her do whatever she wanted but the signs where clear that she was messing with someone else. I mentally denied it for a while as I truly believed she would never do something like this but eventually I had to confront the truth and break up with her. I was so devastated I packed up the bare minimum of my stuff and got my own apartment. If that wasn’t enough I still had to work with her and what’s worse is I found out the guy she was messing with was twice her age and someone I kinda looked up to. This is when I started slipping up at work a lot finding it hard to think but thank god my family supported me through what was the roughest part of my life so far. 

Eventually my now ex moved in with her much older new bf and switched shifts but I would still occasionally see him on mine when he worked overtime. I would get so angry my head would hurt just knowing he was in the same building as me but I told myself I needed to live better to be better but the damage was mostly done as I was soon on my final written warning at work for making so many mistakes. And the inevitable finally happened. I was fired because I didint catch a mistake someone else made when it went through my machine and was knocked down emotionally again. 

A part of me was happy I’ll never see that shit place again but I had great friends there I dearly miss but I picked myself up and told myself this is an opportunity to live for myself and choose a better future on my terms tied down by no one. But that changed when I tried to get unemployment hoping that will get me through until I could get a new job but instead I was left in the dark not knowing if I was approved or not my bills piled up quickly and I tried every phone number and email I could find but still to this day nothing no unemployment money no confirmation if I was approved or not I quickly started having panic attacks even now as I write this I’m mentally freaking out. The only good news is my parents are paying for my bills which leaves me feeling pathetic and like all this is my fault. My mental issues have never been hitting me so hard as they are now and I just don’t know what to do a part me feels like when I get a new job I’ll just fuck it up again and again.

I don't talk to my friends or family about this and I'm  overflowing right now. This may come off as woe is me but I can't keep  this in anymore and just need a place to release.

tw: self harm and sexual assault

I  called a crisis line today sobbing and was told no one could come out  until tomorrow at the earliest and tomorrow wasn't even guaranteed. I  haven't left my house in about two months. I'm not eating or sleeping  well, I've been crying for the last three days and just relapsed with  sh.

I'm in my late 20s. Every  single time I have reached out for help I have been turned away in some  form. I went to a doctor in my first year of university crying saying I  was suicidal and she pretty much told me there's nothing she can do. No  resources or somewhere else to try just nothing she could do. When I  asked if I could take a moment to get myself together since I was  crying, she told me to go to the bathroom. I get doctors are busy and  she probably had someone waiting to come in but that was the first time I  asked for help and her reaction made me bottle up and I didn't try to  access help for years after.

When I  got a therapist a few years ago, I walked into the building and burst  into tears. I had (and still never have) told anyone about the sexual  assault I experienced in childhood and walking into the appointment I  was terrified. When I was invited into the room, already with tears  streaming down my face, I had to ask her around 20\~ minutes into the  session for some tissues since they were across the room. Again, she's a  person and I know she wasn't withholding tissues to further upset me  but that introduction didn't make me feel safe with her so again, I  bottled up and got nothing out of my few sessions with her.

I  could go on but there's no reason to, this isn't a unique experience.  I'm just exhausted. I can't believe I'm going to feel like this for the  rest of my life. I can't feel like this for the rest of my life it truly  isn't worth it.

I was assaulted  twice when I was in the 8th grade and my trauma response to it was to  completely bury it. I was in my early 20s when I remembered the first  assault, that's how good my brain was at erasing it, and only realized  the second one was assault shortly after that. Ever since these memories  returned, they play in a constant loop in my brain. I'll be having a  fine day and all of a sudden I'm back in that bed paralyzed and It's  debilitating. I had two of my best friends visit me back in October for  the first time since covid hit and I ruined one of our last nights  together because I got sucked back in and couldn't snap out of it.

I  feel like I don't have any control of my emotions, my life or my  future. I have no money, I don't have a job and I can't bring myself to  get a job because honestly what is the point? What am I working towards?

I  should have talked to the people in my life earlier because I now lack  the ability or courage to. How do I start this conversation when my body  physically rejects the words and it gets stuck in my chest. I guess  that's what anonymity on this internet is for.

Thoughts  of suicide are the only thing that calms me down at this point. Maybe  calms me down isn't the right wording but more levels me out. It's  reassuring to me that I have an out but I promised myself I wouldn't  while my parents are alive.

I'm  unsure where I am right now mentally. I've been crying constantly for  days but I don't feel anything, I'm hallow. I haven't been in this place  before where I have these intense outward emotions and outbursts but  feel nothing inside if that makes sense.

I  just don't know what to do anymore and truthfully don't want to do  anything anymore. I'm rotting away in this isolated hole I dug for  myself and I'm just making it deeper and deeper so I can't get out. When  I do start and attempt to climb out I just fall down even deeper.

How  do I ask for help when I don't have the words? I just don't know what  to do. I don't want to think or feel like this anymore but I can't get  out of the spiral.

I pick my skin nonstop, repeat my thoughts on a loop all day (usually it’s the things I have to do that day that I keep repeating in my head), I get very stressed when the house isn’t spotless (which it usually isn’t because we have a baby and I’m a messy person), and when I get into something (like a hobby), I get very obsessed with it and get irrationally angry when I have to put it down and focus on other things (like cleaning, caring for the baby, etc.).

I’m also always tired and generally very angry. I’m constantly catching myself being furious with strangers for no real reason. Worst of all, every few weeks I have a breakdown set off by something small. Today I was irritated that I had so many chores to do, and how running a household/raising a baby seems like an endless string of draining chores, when I’d rather be working on my hobby. When I was making baby food, the processor leaked all over the cabinets again, even though my husband just fixed it yesterday. I flipped out and spent the next few hours screaming at my husband and eventually said I wanted a divorce, packed my bags and left. Now I’m sitting in my car, typing this. I don’t want a divorce. I love my husband (but he is completely clueless on how to help me). 

I’ve tried a handful of therapists, but none of them worked for me. I don’t think talk therapy is helpful for me, or if it is, I don’t think I’ll be able to find a therapist who gives me helpful advice. I don’t have very many family members or friends.

Somehow I have lost all my feelings. Let's say i see a beautiful lady, like actually gorgeous. But I don't feel the attraction towards her just even a little bit. I don't feel love for anyone, neither my parents nor my pet or just anybody. Same goes for anger, I don't feel angry even if someone Insults, defames or taunts me for my insecurities or shortcomings. It has caused me to lose my relationships with my family and friends. Only feeling I am left with is hopelessness.

I had several different interests like (very specifically)drawing, videogames, workout, socialization, tech stuf etc. Now I've lost it all, I have absolutely no ambition nor motivation to do anything. When I look at my former self years ago, I feel like I am an absolutely different person. Everything these days needs a very strong reason to be done. Only driving factor for me to work is MONEY.

I have no friends anymore, i started isolating myself when i was 16 due to depression, family hasent come over to celebrate my birthday, my brothers have not wished me a happy birthday, none of my coworkers have wished me a happy birthday, none of my online buddies have wished me a happy birthday, i have no pets. So my birthdays just really show me how lonely i really am and i hate it. I just sit here on my birthday, no cake, nothing, all alone at home, playing videogames.

I grew up in a somewhat happy home, until mom and dad seperated when i was 8. Then i started moving between mom and dad frequently, and thus meant i never really had my own room growing up so i couldn't bring friends home during my childhood. My mom met another man after the seperation, and he turned out to be really abusive to my mom, he hit her, he cheated on my mom, he constantly lied about everything, he did shady business on the side so there was cop cars patrolling outside the house every now and then. I have been called the F slur by my stepdad.

My dad struggled with bills and money in general for a while when i lived with him, we had no hot water for a while, so we had to boil water when we wanted to shower, and one day they cut the electricity so we were out of electricity for months.

I've had a boxcutter knife placed against my throat by one of the criminal ''tough'' boys in school, i have recieved a death threat over a football match, all beacuse i'm gay. Out of the blue my boyfriend ghosted me 6 months ago and still not heard a peep since. I was reported to the police for protecting my younger brother against bullies ( he got bullied because he was born fully deaf on both ears) and faced expulsion from the school, mom had to go on several meetings to make sure i wasen't expelled. My last friend died in July 2015.

I work at a job i do not enjoy, the people i work with are good, but the job itself i dislike. But it pays good so i keep doing it.

Still i keep trying every day despite not really having anything to live for. I do not know what keeps me going. It feels like i'm just on autopilot during most of the days. I was taught from a young age to bottle up emotions

I have tried to end it 2 times before, both times I went to a different country(France, Portugal) and was right on the edge but miraculously am still here. But a couple of days after I go back home my depression comes back 10x harder. It’s to the point I am just existing, not living anymore. It doesn’t help either that I have gone back to my dysfunctional family again. 

Now my plan is I will go to Oslo, rent a apartment and swallow pills and end it for good. The reason I travel is so that I can be as far away from anyone that knows me.

I've had moderate to severe depression for over ten years, and it's not showing any signs of letting up. I've attempted suicide a few times, damn near succeeded, but no attempts recently; I've had better luck managing the ideation or getting help before it becomes a danger, though I know no safety plan is foolproof.

Anyway, my wife has been in the hospital for months, so we're legally separated and I'm on my own again. Due to COVID and my permanent disability, I've been going for weeks in between seeing another human being in person. The isolation can get surprisingly oppressive, as I'm an introvert and like being alone... just not this much I guess! I've got some friends and family (including my wife) that I talk to, but a disconnected voice on the other end of a call can't really do much.

The problem is I'm just so far down I'm not looking after myself, not eating well, sleep is completely off the rails, usually I can't sleep for days. housework? what's that? hygiene? why bother. And this has been ongoing for long enough that every day just gets more overwhelming when I think about all the responsibilities that have piled up that aren't going to go away and no one can help with. Living in a cluttered, dirty house is also not good for my mental health. And I have one seriously short fuse, which is not like me at all. I've barely managed to not bite anyone's head off.

I don't know if it's because I'm just tired, or if my muscles have finally started to atrophy after months of sedentary life, or both, but I've started tripping over things because I can't seem to pick my foot up as quickly as I expect to. Lost a toenail thanks to that. Next step is probably falling and cracking my head open on something. I get winded walking up the stairs, which is a far cry from the running and boxing I used to do. I'm not even driving, as I don't feel safe doing that.

I have lots of good hobbies, but I've been floundering between them every other week, it seems. Nothing has staying power. This has the knock-on effect of making it very hard to be a part of any communities surrounding those hobbies.

My days lately consist of talking to my wife for an hour, maybe talking to a friend for a bit, trying to play a game for half an hour before I get fed up, and then 16+ hours of mindless content consumption because I couldn't be fucked to do anything else.

I’m not sure if I actually have a depressive disorder, but I have a lot of depressive tendencies. Although I have friends (on paper, that is) and I’m in a relationship, I still feel very alone. I get nervous asking people to hang out - especially my bf - because I feel like I am a burden to their life and am better off staying by myself.

I always feel like I’m in the background; the extra that nobody really cares about. If I died today, barely anyone would notice and life would just resume to normal because I’m not all too important to anyone to begin with. 

I know I’m not perfect, but I really try my best to seem approachable and be kind to others and make them happy. I think my tendency to occasionally be closed off in large group settings (due to my social anxiety) is a turn off for a lot of people, but I really can’t help that.

I’ve never spent as much time with any woman and genuinely enjoyed it as much as I did with her. We’re weren’t dating, but we weren’t limited to friendship, or at least I didn’t think so. We spent almost every day together whether it was in person or on FaceTime. I shared things with her that I’ve never shared with any other human being on this planet. I’ve gotten involved in physical fights over her. I never tell anyone in my family about people I am romantically involved with but I told them about her. I truly thought me and her would spend the rest of our lives together. However, over time I noticed I started getting obsessed with her and eventually began stalking her. But that’s not when things went sour. Stupidly I started emotionally pulling away I don’t know if that was because I knew my obsessive behaviors would end up ruining our relationship or because deep down I knew that she didn’t want to be with me but I did it. And when I did that was when my life turned to shit and the depression kicked in. Around the time of our relationship deteriorating quarantine began also. So as if I already wasn’t lonely enough without her COVID amplified that x1000. I don’t have any friends and I don’t talk to my family about personal issues so the pain I felt I had to deal with. I’ve been bodybuilding for the past 6 years so I thought focussing primarily on that would end the pain…it didn’t. Every now and then we would interact but it was on occasion. Then when shit got really dark was when I saw her prom pictures(even though I stopped stalking her physically I never stopped cyber stalking). She was with her new boyfriend this resulted in me having a mental breakdown(wasn’t the first time I had a breakdown over her). I cried all night wondering why I had to see that or what does he have that I don’t then I accepted the fact that she never felt the same way about me that’s when I decided I was going to kill myself. I then went and got my dads gun and held it to my head I cried and cried when I finally pulled the trigger Nothing happened it was because the gun was on safety after some more crying I decided I wasn’t going to follow through with it. After that a dark period in my life like no other began. I started self harming in various ways wondering why I had to witness her in love with someone who wasn’t me. Eventually I got over it and her(or so I thought). Just once I stopped self harming and thought the depression was ending I went to my schools open house for my senior year. There I talked to her and learned we had a class together. After she told me that I thought this was going to be some sort of miracle or divine intervention. I believed that this would be when me and her rekindle our relationship. Once school started I realized this was way worse. Me and her hang around different crowds(she has a clicky friend group. I don’t have friends at all). We never interacted and I constantly saw her in class was flirting with this guy. Seeing that started a whole new wave of depression. I began self harming again and eventually attempted suicide again(this time I tried to hang myself with an extension chord) my second real attempt failed as the wood pole I hang the extension chord from snapped. So the cycle continued me stalking her, self harming, and eventually thinking I got over her(I didn’t). Now more time has passed and I saw something earlier that ruined me, it was a Tiktok of her and an old friend of mine announcing their relationship. And I really thought the pain I felt when I saw her with her ex boyfriend was bad. Seeing that made me realize there’s no point in continuing this endless cycle of pain…so I’m going to give myself two more days before I kill myself. If in these next two days I can’t get over her and become happy again(I won’t). Im going to kill myself through od(I can’t fail this one). When I close my eyes all I can see is her smile and all I can hear is her voice I’m tired of not being able to be with her. And my life isn’t worth living without her

My depression is always with me but iv'e noticed it gets worse in the winter (right now). I socially withdrawal from my friends, I find it really hard to enjoy things, the list goes on. My grades are decent, I got into art education and marine biology, both at different univeristies and I'm also waiting on replies from business, interior design, and urban design/planning programs. My dad and mom don't want me taking a gap year but, I still don't know what I want to do with my life.  I'm going on vacation for Christmas to visit family for a month so I need to really try to be happy when I'm there. Once I get back I want to talk to my doctor about anti- depressants or literally anything that will help me.

Should I take a gap year? What should I tell my parents?

Advice on how to stop withdrawing socially and to not feel so empty and persistently sad?

Please tell me what worked for you, if you are comfortable.

I've really felt better, more energy overall, and haven't been putting myself down like I used to. I've also been less anxious when talking to new people and making plans to get together with friends. It's only been a week, but I can see some good things happening. 

However, the last week I've also had some of the worst, most fucked up dreams I've had in a while. One was about my parents divorcing from which I woke up crying like a child, one was me screaming profanities at my father, and last night was about me basically being abandoned and left alone by friends, family, and everyone else in the dream. 

Could this be a sign that my brain is trying to finally work through and process personal frustrations? Is this a desperate attempt my by sick brain to keep me in the uncomfortable-yet-known-and-understood cycle of depression where at least I can be reasonably secure of the outcome even though it's bad?

- lost my cat, who got hit by a car late at night because I let her out 2 weeks later
- basically lost my job
- spent all my crypto on weed and dumb stuff through 2020, now worth a few $100,000. 
- spiraled into a deep depression, some sort of manic episode i guess, i don't even don't even recognize myself looking back
- my girlfriend, high school sweetheart of 7 years, left me for a 15 years older stranger who came to visit our country for 2 weeks, kinda wealthy
- have a $1.500 debt


That all happened in the span of 60 days, how can life get fucked up and turned upside down so fast what the hell...I spent the last rest of this year basically reliving the traumatic break up and everything invloved with it. I cry every day, i relapsed on benzos and heroin, im turning 24 next month, no job, no drivers license, still living at moms. Each day feels like groundhog day. My mental health had always been shit but this year caused a rapid decline in it. 

I guess I realized a lot of thing about myself too and came to the painful realiaztion that im the only one to blame for the fuck ups I did thru my life that have led me to this point. I know a screwed up a lot of things and had a bright future but could never really handle responsibilities so I just avoided them. I dont really know what to do and im not sure where to start at fixing my life because I have zero motivation and fear failure. I know i need to kick my ass out of this but how am i supposed to do this when my brain just feels like its not working properly and i dont even know how to explain it, like im goin nuts in my own head. I dont really want to kill myself but i also hope i dont wake up tommorrow. 

This is just some rant idk i felt like letting this out here because atleast here maybe people will understand my situation or idk.. 

Much love

EDIT: I'd also like to add a comment about substance abuse, because sometimes it goes hand in hand with depression and other mental health problems. You can try to drown your sorrows, but in vain: they can and will swim. All those who try to escape reality, if you don't face your life you will be getting more problems on top of problems, which can have a snowballing effect and some day they will destroy you and tear you fully apart. I think it's important for all of us on this sub to research something about ""anhedonia"", since if you're on this sub you're probably suffering from it. It's especially relevant to those with addictions since it's the number one reason you will probably relapse. Take care.",depression,2021-12-05 03:33:42

Some background information about me: I had a very rough childhood because I was bullied in school beacuse of my inatentiveness and quirky traits so I found peace and safety at home with videogames and a seemingly loving family. My parents were always the type of people who would rather secure the peace in the family than to adress and validate everyones feelings and were also raised to suck things that bother them up most of the time. I have very little friends and I dont feel save in a lot of places. I do go to therapy and try to learn new ways to cope and life a good life. 

&#x200B;

I had an incident some time ago. I had some friends that weren't really good for me with whom I smoked a lot of weed and who were trying to lead me into a direction in life that I thought wasnt the best for me. At the same time I god prescribed methylphenidate for my ADHD for the first time in my life. I think the combination of both the weed and the methylphenidate kinda made a barrier inside me disappear and I leashed out on my dad with some pretty hard and panicking words in the kind of that I thought that we have never had a functioning father-son connection and that I never really felt connected to him. I don't know where these words came from, obviously from a very dark place in my brain. I couldnt see my family for a few weeks after that and my mother stated to me that she will take care of my dad first now. I never felt more like a fuckup more than in that time and I just didnt know who I was back then. I then got off of the meds and minimized my weed intake drastically, through the help of my cousin got back together with my father where we both cried hugging eachother and telling ourselves that were sorry. I love him so much and I feel so bad even now that multiple months have passed. I also got newly prescribed wellbutrin and its working very well for me. My mom isnt the same towards me as well since then. She acts more distant than before, like always being suspicious of me.

My father was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and my whole family isnt doing very well since everyone is under a lot of pressure. 

I recently had a discussion with my mother and I could tell that she was frustrated about everything that is happening rn in our family. She basically told me that she would kick me out of the house if I was not vaccinated against corona already. The discussion continued and came to the topic of smoking weed. I told my mom the truth that I occationally do smoke weed but only if Im in a really good mood and just want to enjoy my time and not out of anxiety and thats about one hundreth of the amount I smoked before and that I really feel myself having everything under controll. She then told me in a passice agressive way that she hopes that such an outbreak will never happen again. Later on I confronted my mom about what she has told me before and she litterally told me that she is afraid of me and is distancing herself. MY OWN MOM FEARS ME.

I just dont know what to do, where to go or what to do with myself. Im in such despair and just feel so unloved and uncared for by everything. I just want a save place where I feel loved because I have a really hard time doing that for myself right now",depression,2021-12-05 22:10:59

I don't wanna be alive. There is nothing inside me that wants to be alive. My siblings and I have had a very rough life and they have told me on multiple occasions that they wouldn't survive my death. Everytime I am on the edge I always see the faces of my nephew and niece. They wanna play with their mother but she can't be there for them because she is crying and grieving because her little sister died. The guilt is so strong that it's strong enough to fight this big urge to just go. But I wanna go, so badly. 
People tend to say it's depression that's speaking or if your life is different you'll be happier but the thing is, my life has been great for a whole year.  Everyday was almost just fun and joy but on the most, happiest day I still felt like if I had the chance to erase my existence I would do it.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am really lost here. I can't find any desire to stay but the guilt I feel is enough to keep me here, so I am stuck in this god damn miserable life. I tried to accept that I have to live this life, I really tried to get my brain to accept it but it always comes back. This strong desire to just close my eyes once and for all.

And my mom isn't taking it seriously she's like... Okay... 
And it was so fucked up because no matter how much I laid into him he was just fine he almost had a smirk like ""you're never gonna get me"" type of thing... 
He's gonna fucking die... And get away with everything he's done to me and stormy.. what a fucking pussy ass waste of space. 

He hurt me so bad, I just wanted my dad I didn't want him to get in trouble I just didn't wanna go to foster care  I didn't tell anybody to protect him even tho he was actively hurting me I just wanted my dad for a little bit I didn't know how to tell anybody without losing him I didn't want him to leave me again I didn't want him to abandon me again... That's all and him taking it out on me, I let him, it was his therapy and I thought well, if it makes him stay I'll do anything.
I just wanted a dad, even if he beat me because I was a fucking child I just didn't want him to abandon me again..
Uuugggggh I fucking hate this I'm so angry I'm fucking seething with rage I'm such a fucking fool and he's such a fucking bastard there's no words.

I'm confused and so angry that...my child self misses him :(

But how he treated me, is evil and heartbreaking. It's the biggest betrayal I will ever experience. He took advantage of me to the most... Heart breaking degree. 

Can somebody please just validate me, please. I'm hurting, so fucking bad. Even though I'm working on myself and trauma, it's just still... Actively traumatic and I need someone to assure me like, this whole thing is fucked up. Like I said I tried to tell my mom and she responded like... ""Why are you freaking out"" basically.

I been sitting on-call in a hotel room for a couple days doing nothing. I thought having alone time might cause me to work on some goals I had like social media, nutrition, working out, singing etc…. But instead I just want to sleep all day. And whenever I attempt something it gets too overwhelming within the few min I start it. I miss my cat, my bf, & video-games. Not gonna lie I miss smoking 🍃 because it helped so much with my depression. I know those things are “distractions” but I did a whole lot better being around them.  I actually had a great routine with working out & everything… 

My family is so unsupportive if that though & think this FA job is a perfect way to get out of my head. They also HATE my bf. He has a past fs but he makes me feel safe. I used to be so happy & was so passionate about learning everything I can. I had big goals. In fact, I had so many I didn’t know which one to start.

I went to therapy before but I felt like my therapist didn't just understand me or I didn't understand him. It's hard to focus. I just can't stop. It's very exhausting. I just want peace I just want peace in my mind. Inwish I could end it all but I have kids and I feel to guilty to leave them in this world. Idk what to do?  I have noone in my life to talk to I've been keeping my whole life to myself and I just want someone to listen to me I can't even talk to my own wife about she just tell me to toughen up.. so that's y I feel so alone don't know where to go to talk too.

I spend most of my days on my phone and just enough time studying to pass. I haven’t had friends nor a regular life for years, even before college. I’ve grown a lot in the past years, healing from childhood trauma, learning self-love, learning to feel emotions and not repress them, learning boundaries. But I still live a life of a loner, and the only people I talk to are either acquaintances or romantic/flirting/intense relationships it’s just me sharing too much because I’m desiring connection. I actually never have had the sort of life I should have, I never went out with friends as a young person (homeschooled and neglected) and so in a way I don’t know what I’m missing. But I’m  unhappy, even sometimes I flirt with the idea of TW s***cide when it all seems stupid and not worth it. I know I should try to make friends but it’s like I don’t even want to try, and I know that I’m actually afraid of that true lasting connection, afraid of someone having a hold on me, at least I feel that way. I’m seeing a therapist so hopefully the more time it will help. But how can I get over myself and be friendly on social situations? I’m at a very small community so it’s rather welcoming and a good place to make friends, though there is not anyone here that I share a lot with, but I don’t mind that I just want people to hang out out with , as long as they’re normal and chill. But when the opportunity comes up for me to start a convo or connect I usually shrink away. I guess any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

It's heartbreaking. I struggled with similar issues as her (depression, eating disorder) and it really moved something in me. This is gonna sound so cliché but it's really really not worth it. I remember when I was about 14 she pierced my nose and saw I had some SH cuts on my wrist and she told me: ""I did it as well but things will get better,you'll see"".
Now, she's dead and will never be able to see that things can, in fact, get better.
What she did was in her mind the best option. I totally understand why as I can't even begin to imagine all the other stuff she was going through, but the void she left in the life of everyone who knew her, even if just a little, really sucks. At her funeral her little brother, mom and dad had a speech. It's surreal how her struggles came to an end but now her family has to live with the fact that she's gone. 
I don't know what the point of this post is but I guess what I wanna say is that even if you think no one loves you, they'd be better off without you or stuff like that, don't believe it. People care, people love you and you will be missed dearly if you decide to end it all. Talk to someone, try new things, change routine, do whatever you feel might actively help you but don't kill yourself. At some point in the future you'll be able to look back at where you were and where you are now and you'll be proud of yourself.

I am the epitome of bad luck. My name literally means bad luck in reverse, and with my surname, it means super bad luck. I was the least favourite child due to bad grades, was bullied for 11 years, stuck in hometown wasted 3 years because my parents doesn't want me to go to another town alone, pressured into studying a major I did not like, ended up in a toxic relationship one after another, got into a company who does scam for my first job, spiralled into severe depression, I left as soon as I could, and if God really does pity me, he shouldn't have given me a ray of hope. 

I found a job I really loved. Great superior who fights for her underling's rights, lovely working environment, and although I had my fair share of hardship there, life was starting to look up for me. Then my superior left. The boss hated us just because we were my superior's underling. There's nothing left for me there. 

Then I quit and went into another company. If I had the ability to travel through time, I would slap myself very hard. If you think the overtime in anime or in Japanese tv dramas are an exaggeration, they were not for me. 1 year there feels like 10 years of life shaved off of me. 2 weeks worth of overtime replacement were accumulated in 1 month. 3 weekends of overtime none stop, could not risk having rest at all because the boss would shame us in front of the entire office, and be screamed at with offensive words.

To him, the employees are nothing more than a puppet that can be replaced, a dog who wags its tail to gain that itty bitty bit of salary. And I kid you not when I say they did not even have overtime replacement before I fought for it. The boss expects his employees to work for free after working hours because ""we love what we do, and you can't call yourself xxx (position) when you complain this much.""

My health plummeted, the tiny scrap of confidence that I have gained from the previous job was just gone, and the worst part is my mental health spiralled back to the lowest point, and it keep on digging and digging, getting lower and lower with each passing day. I quit the job after 1 year and decided to come home, work freelance from now on, and try to nurse my mental health back, where I would not tremble in fear when I'm in a crowd, where I won't scratch myself to the point I almost bled when my parents asked me what's next, and to able to talk like a normal person instead of stuttering when I try to speak. 

I know this is a bad thing to say, but the global thing works in favour of me. My parents did not pressure me to go back out to look for a ""9-5 job"", I have the time to take care of myself without people constantly belittling me for the choice of coming home, and I can be away from the city and to just enjoy the night in my room without the honking outside the window. 

And I guess I got too comfortable. I'm aware that the global problem will be solved one day, and things were starting to get back to normal. It got me thinking that maybe it's time for me to find a real job and don't make my parents worry about me. 

But as I scroll through the job listings, I find nothing for me. I don't see myself in any of the jobs listed, and I don't see my future. It was all bleak, blank, black, and I hate to see myself like this. With this thought, I might just end myself one of these days. 

What am I doing here? I am no help to my parent, I am not a good sister to my siblings, and I am no good to society. Everything I do ends on a bad note, I put myself in danger no matter what I do, so what's the point of continuing on? Why do I let myself suffer this much when I can just end things with a single slice down my wrist, but I love my family, my parents, my siblings, my old grandmother, I love them all. I want to be free of all these, but my love for them is tying me down. If it wasn't for them, I would've died a long time ago.

Maybe it's a bit vain, but I like to think that I've written my own allegory of the cave. Sorry if it sounds a bit childish, I wrote it for a story contest at my school. Also, I wrote this in Spanish and translated it into English myself, so the translation will surely make it difficult to understand. Sorry and thanks for reading it beforehand

Imagine an empty universe where an infinite series of straight and parallel paths made up of tiles takes place. In each of these paths, there is a person. And each year each person advances a tile. The fact is that people always move forward, with a firm step, stomping. And we move forward with the assurance that we are not going to fall. People are convinced that they are advancing on a path of roses, a luminous, ascending path. They are convinced that at the end of that road there is a goal. And they are also convinced that if they work and advance enough, they will reach the goal. Now imagine that someone notices something on his face, something that bothers him, something that irritates him. And when he takes it off, he realizes that what he's holding is a blindfold.

He looks up and nothing. Everything is dark. He can only see two or three tiles in front of him. He looks sideways and sees nothing. He looks up at the sky, and he doesn't see anything either. It is as if around him there is a cloud of darkness that prevents him from seeing beyond. And he knows that this cloud exists because if he doesn't give it importance, it becomes transparent. Enough to be able to see around him. And now he can see the endless rows of tiles. But in each row, there is a cloud of darkness, and no matter how hard he tries, he cannot make the other clouds transparent. At least he knows that in the center of each cloud there is a person, even if he cannot see it. The more he looks around, the more he realizes everything there is. He realizes that although the paths are parallel, the clouds are not. There are clouds more advanced than others. If he looks his own way, he realizes that it never ends. There is no goal. And that's when he starts to worry.

Imagine that it is time to advance a tile. When he looks down, he realizes that the tiles are glass, brittle. And he can see the emptiness behind them. He used to move forward with confidence, stomping his foot, but now he's scared. He can fall, he can break the tile, or he can fall over the sides. It’s so easy to fall. This time he has advanced carefully, afraid of breaking the tile. He still has the bandage on his hand, but he doesn't want to put it on. Now that he had seen everything he couldn't help wondering. Have other people also removed the blindfold? What if they never take it off? He would have to help everyone get it off, but the paths are too far apart. And no matter how much he yells, no one is going to listen to him.

And he suddenly sees how a shadow falls into the void. He has not been able to see it well, but he is sure that something has fallen. He looks to the right of him and on the next road, he watches the cloud of darkness dissipate. But there is no one, just a broken tile. And he worries more. He no longer likes what he is seeing. And he puts the blindfold back on.",depression,2021-12-06 00:03:38
294,r9lwcb,What do you do besides drink?,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9lwcb/what_do_you_do_besides_drink/,3,"I’ve pretty solidly narrowed the trigger, if not the root, of my depression down to drinking. If I don’t drink for a few days I’m happy (enough),if I do I end up binging and becoming miserable until I can get myself to stop.

I’m hoping this sub isn’t just folks currently dealing with depression (I’m sorry to all of you, shit sucks), but also some who have gone through it and found a way out. 

For those who are similar to me and drink too much but managed to break the cycle, what do you do? I work from home, which means I’m just stuck in the house 24x7 unless I get out and do something, but I just don’t know what to do besides go to the bar. And guess what, I’m currently at one because I just don’t know what else to do. Sometimes I go to a movie or go to a store just to walk around, and something even that simple does make me feel better, but even that is just monotonous.

Just looking for advice for something else to spend my time doing that’ll keep me off the sauce. Foot is currently broken so exercising is off the list, which by itself fucking sucks.",depression,2021-12-05 23:59:11
295,r990m0,I feel like it gets worse each day,10,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r990m0/i_feel_like_it_gets_worse_each_day/,5,"I’ve (24F) had depression ever since I was 12, and possibly some anxiety sprinkled in. 

I swear the older I get, the worse the depression and anxiety becomes. 

When I was in college, my anxiety was at its worst. I was having panic attacks each day, crying a lot. I got sick of it, so I decided to “re-wire my brain”; whenever I was in a situation where I felt anxious, I forced myself to become numb. I did this over, and over, and over. Then, I no longer had to force myself, I became numb, even in situations that would make normal people anxious. I failed to realize that what I did had consequences. I could no longer feel extreme happiness/joy/excitement over positive things. I was 19 when this all occurred. 

I ended up dropping out of college because I was too poor for it, and joined the army. Met some cool people along the way, but the army doesn’t help with my depression; they claim to care about soldiers mental health, but they truly don’t. They expect me to find a therapist, but military healthcare sucks when it comes to mental health, and they won’t even find a therapist for me. 

My boyfriend of 3 years (who is also in the army, we live together), insists that I get help and that he will pay for me to see a therapist. Although I appreciate that offer, I feel it’s just kinda wrong to have my SO pay for me to un-fuck my mind. The idea makes me uncomfortable for some unknown reason. 

As a kid, I grew up with a narcissist mother, so I have it drilled into my head that I’m useless, suck at just about everything, etc. She would always compare me to other kids, even my friends; “Jessica gets straight As, why can’t you do that?” Or “Oh, you want to work for the FBI? That’s too hard of a job, our brains don’t work like that”. If I ever strived for something, she’d verbally swat me down immediately. It got worse in my teenage years, she would get drunk, become nasty, I’ve had objects thrown at me before, a kitchen chair being one of them. She even put me in a headlock once and tried to choke me out. There’s much more she’s done, but I won’t get into it. A year ago she got diagnosed with breast cancer, and she has changed her attitude towards me, probably realizing that she wasn’t the best mother. But it’s too late, 23 years too late, the mental damage is already done. 

The depression of course runs on her side of the family, how ironic because she never showed sympathy for my depression. All I got was a “suck it up, that’s life”. 

So here I am now, my self-hatred getting worse each day. Got laid off back in October, have applied to so many jobs, and still nothing. Got pulled from a college class due to lack of participation (because of the depression) I feel like such a useless piece of shit. My boyfriend works, he is supportive of me, and I appreciate it. Yet, no matter how many positive things he says about me, I never believe it. I don’t think I’ll ever be capable of loving myself. 

I’m not suicidal per say, but I do fantasize what it would be like if I had the balls to do it. Normal people are happy they wake up each morning, while I’m disappointed that I do. I wish I could pass in my sleep, or die in a quick freak accident. I don’t dare tell anyone in my life that I think about these things. 

It keeps getting worse. My boyfriend and I rescued a dog from a shelter, and I’m a big animal lover, but… not even that has improved my mood. 

I try so hard to keep my fake, happy facade around people, while in private I have mental breakdowns and just cry. Im not usually one to cry about anything in general, so this is how I know the depression is getting really bad. 

How long can I take this? Im so sick of it all. Sick of living my useless life. All I’m doing is wasting oxygen and taking up space.",depression,2021-12-05 11:28:13

297,r9bfjh,I need to get it out.,7,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9bfjh/i_need_to_get_it_out/,2,"Hi. I'm 21 F and feel like I've been through too much at too young.

I'm the daughter of One foreign parent and one American. My father ordered my mother from a Magazine after a really bad divorce. He use to tell me they were pen pals til I turned 18 and then told me the truth...

My mother is bipolar and has had mood swings ever since I was a child. She often took days off and stayed in bed. She wouldn't cook or clean during that time and left me and my two siblings to fend for ourselves. She never really cleaned the house to begin with. The bathroom was always disgusting and our fridge was full of moldy food that she would tell us to eat when she didn't want to go grocery shopping. She refused to do laundry and when she did she would leave wet clothes in the washer for days or leave it in our basement. My clothes always smelt like mold and it's been a bad trigger ever since. 

We never threw anything away including clothes. My mom came from a third world country and a very poor area. So I understand why she acted this way. In middle school I only had two pairs of pants a three t shirts, one coat and a pair of sneakers. She refused to buy me more and said I should be greatful. In a way it did humble me. US standards all of what I described was neglect.

When I was older I realized she was very abusive and no other kids were being raised the same way. She would kick, punch, slap, and pull my hair pretty often. She went so far to choke me til I passed out once or twice. I'd cry and I slowly fell into the same depressive habits; Staying in bed all day, skipping school and just sleeping it off. She took it pretty far and told me to kill myself. 

In the 5th grade she told me only losers kill themselves. I took a jump rope and tied it around my neck. I was in tears when I did a head dive into concrete and woke up in the middle of the night. I just went to bed like it didn't happen. My second sucide attempt was a little more hands on where my mother handed me a belt and told me to hang myself with it. I tied it to the top of a shower curtain rod and jumped. There was no hesitation. When it broke and I hit the floor my mother stood watching me in the doorway.

""if you weren't so fat you would have been able to kill yourself correctly""

I saw that alot of failed sucide attempts normally say that people instantly regret it. I never regretted it. I regretted that I didn't do it correctly. To this day I feel like I should have tried harder or done some more research. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I've tried therapy but I'm just treated as an intrigueing research study by my therapist and they wonder how I couldve turned out "" ok "" and a decent member of society.

also. She sexually abused me. all. the. time. and I didn't realize it was sexual abuse til now. 

fuck. Am I the only one? Does anyone get it?",depression,2021-12-05 14:09:47

Currently I am eating some breadsticks my mom made and feeling cold because my rooms heating system isn't working properly during winter. I want to share a little bit of my story. I am depressed. I feel like nothing in my life really matters. I don't feeling much happiness. Sure, I get a taste of it from time to time, but that lasts about ten-ish minutes and is gone. This year's one and only time I felt  genuinely happy was during the month of September.

**September** \- My school just started on the first of the month. I am in my fourth, and last, year of high school. Here's the story of how I met two wonderful girls. It was a yet another boring math lesson and I was doing nothing so I decided to write on the table. Where I'm from, we have two school shifts and we share our classrooms with the other peers. I wrote on the table asking about if the person sitting here watched any Marvel or anime. To my surprise I had gotten an answer. So we started talking back and forth and it made my school experience actually interesting. Soon after we made a Discord group chat and even hanged out once. Never in my life have I gotten so many hugs and head pats and cuddle. It was such a comforting and stress relieving. One day, one of the girls invited me over to watch a movie. We obviously didn't watch it and I had my first kiss. It was such a beautiful experience. We even made out and I got to hold a naked woman's body. We went a step forward and I was supposed to ""eat her out"" but me being absolutely a virgin with zero experience had no idea how to properly do it and I didn't make her cum. I, to this day, feel bad about it because she wasted her first time. Ever since that day our friendship was starting to decline. I made some mistakes because I overthink too much and fast-forward to right now we don't even talk anymore. 

**After September** \- I have been feeling extremely lonely and hopeless. I botched so many friendships and I don't even know what should I do now. I had countless nights when I cried myself to sleep. I would imaginary scream to the top of my lungs but so my parents can't hear. Maybe I'm too harsh on myself but I just can't forgive myself for all the bad things I've done. I don't believe in God but I do believe in Karma. I believe that all the good things I've been saving up in my ""good deeds cup"" have been used on that one sunday. From then it's just been bad things and bad things only. I haven't felt any happiness in so long. All I want in my life to have someone I can cling on. Someone I can hug and hold dearly. I want to be a good person and I am trying my best every single day but I just can't handle the loneliness anymore. I cry because I know I am nobody's first choice. I want to be loved. Maybe I had my chance with that girl and I just ruined it. I don't know if I'm even allowed to be sad. It's my fault after all. I just want to feel something. I can't keep up. I hate this world. Why can't I just be treated nice.",depression,2021-12-05 20:05:39

One of my goals for this year had been to start a new job, which came across in August.

Now I feel lost and losing control. Nothing seems to be going right in my new job, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I've lost all structure and routine and feel like I have no time for passions or hobbies anymore. My relationships have fallen to wayside, and I'm focusing on the negative rather than the positive all the time.I don't feel like I am spiralling, and I'm using all the CBT techniques I have learnt, but I'm just a little overwhelmed.

Every time there seems to be a light in the darkness, it appears to get snuffed out quickly, and I'm beginning to feel so alone and sad now.

Last year with the lockdowns it was really hard, I resorted to vodka mostly but that shit's expensive and I'm nearly broke now so I can't buy alcohol anymore, which makes things even harder (I'm a student btw, so I don't get paid, just living on the money I saved from birthdays mainly).

I have a ton of work to do but I never do it because I never feel in the mood to do it. And that's kind of why I'm scared to go see a doctor.

I'd been holding back to seek help professionally due to financial constraints and the fact that I'd been getting better (suicidal thoughts are no longer frequent and I can get on with daily life tasks on most days). however, as some of you may know, it gets very draining on the person caring for someone with depression and I think that's what's happening now - my partner, who is a great bf and shows me what it's like to be loved unconditionally, is getting tired dealing with me. he used to be confident that we have a future together but he is no longer confident now, although he is not gonna give up on us (yet). I know this because we had a truthful talk.

I, too, think that I am very hard to handle and deal with and I have problems controlling my emotions; so my partner wished for me to be able to control myself better as I may have random infrequent outbursts at times (which inflicts physical pain to myself and sometimes him when he is trying to stop me). I tried explaining to him how depression is a mental disorder, where therapy and medication is required, and that it is NOT a choice or decision where I can stop myself from overthinking or feeling depressed. he thinks that I am ""weak"" and can be ""stronger""/strong-willed by telling me things about myself that I already know. but it hurts me to hear it from him, no matter how small/insignificant the things he said about me; on bad days I'd get really triggered and that's when I have my outburts/breakdown. he said that it was a habit for him to ""joke"" around with people he's comfortable with, and he hopes that I would get ""immune"" to it and therefore, getting ""stronger"" mentally.

Well I'm not sure about ""thankfully"" I had a few fleeting fantasies about dying and  my loved ones cashing out my fat life insurance policy and using the money to better their lives in ways I could never help them. But the big thing I've discovered during this so far 6 day isolation is how little I care about myself. I've never been a super neat and clean cut person but I showered every day except for extreme emergencies. Without having to worry about the embarrassment of someone realizing how much I smell I haven't taken a share since going into isolation, I've just been eating on the couch, tossing my trash next to the couch and falling asleep on the couch. 


No one would ever accuse me of being a ray of sunshine and optimism but I'm kind of amazed at just how much of my day to day efforts to keep clean and maintain any sort of appearance are solely for other people and when given the opportunity to do nothing but hide and despair I do so very quickly.

She also seems to be suffering from depression, though I am no psychiatrist. Her grades have been dropping, she doesn't do the basic self-care things like showering enough, and tends to be a lot more on edge now. Maybe it's puberty? I am noticing these signs a lot more than the rest of my family because I started cutting myself when I was 11, too (I never let her know about any of this. She just knows that I got therapy this past year). 

I'm not sure how to tell my parents about getting therapy for her because while she is open to the idea, I doubt that they will take it seriously when she's so young, especially because my sister told me to not mention the self-harm.

I swear I’m on the edge fam. So I got a job about 4 months ago as an X-Ray Aide. It’s crazy cuz I needed surgery on my wrist so this job gave me the connection I needed to find a doctor. But I met this coworker who was great. I ended up getting robbed for my phone during lunch break (long story) and this coworker helped me out. She was very nice when she didn’t have to be which was great. Long story short she is the very few people that truly believes in what I want to do and always reaffirmed the fact that I would reach my goals (Forex Trader) and I didn’t even know her that well. Her personality was also perfect. Everyday I would dread going to work, or I would be very disappointed when I lost a lot money in the forex market, but she would make my day every time and bring a smile to my face. Little did I know I was getting a little attached, especially since I would see her all 5 days a week.

Since I have very little friends and very little of those friends actually understand what I’m doing, I end up getting attached to the people that fully understand and believe in me. Well she changed jobs which made me very sad (although I am very proud that she’s leveling up). The problem is I was in complete isolation, depression, and constant emotional pain ever since I graduated HS and she led me out of that for a little so when she left it hit hard because I realized I would be in complete isolation again. I am constantly filled with suicidal thoughts because the pain I’ve been feeling these past couple of years has been unbearable, but I’m conflicted with the fact that if I were to commit suicide, I would disappoint the people that believed in me and my dreams. But I don’t know how long I’ll be able to withstand the pain I’ve been feeling.

But as of now I’m going to keep pushing because everything happens for a reason. Maybe I need to be in isolation. Maybe she was put in my life to remind me of what I have to do.

I have so many problems, alot I cannot discuss to some. My own family won't even let me. My step father is a hard ass who doesn't understand my issues. And everytime I bring my depression up to my mom she always makes it about her. She constantly berates me about stuff I do and threatens to divorce my step dad, and that hurts just thinking about it. And she constantly goes on mental breakdowns saying how she wants to die and kill herself. This has been happening since I was young. I still love them but its bull shit. I have problems to... at one point our brother had ordered pizza for us because we were really broke, they used a plate that I know has been in the cabinet for years never being washed and I said I didn't want any because I have extreme OCD. She heard one time when I said I wanted to kill myself on one of the few times I've said and, after the pizza debacle she yelled at me saying ""you said you wanted to kill yourself right?"" And threw a knife at my feet basically saying ""if your gonna do it do it, you what ill do it with ya"" she mentally abuses me and constantly makes everything about her. She makes everyones problems hers. And not in a good caring way, but in a great I have to deal with this shit, way. And in ways I get why she's the way she is. She was physically abused by my real father who was a drunk and wrote suicide notes everyday for my family. Once even hanging nooses for each one of us including a 2 yo me. He eventually did kill himself by jumping in front of a train. So I understand her reasons to be the way she is. A lyric from a song explains it perfectly though ""I know its hard living a life like you, but it is not a justification for what you do"" one of my brothers got into a physical altercation with his pregnant wife and I tried stopping him and jumped on his back to put him in a sleeper hold. He threw me over his shoulders and started punching the shit out my face. After, his then wife (they divorced) threatened to divorce him and take their 2 kids. He went into a breakdown and tried killing himself with a kitchen knife and my mom had to fight the knife away from him. I had to watch my ""buddy"" try to kill himself. This happens 3 more times. And one was on the day we buried my grandpa. And it was all because he spent 100 dollars on e cig shit. And I had enough and ran away. They later picked me up but things weren't fixed yet. Fast forward to co**d era, my mom is extremely scared of c**id, and won't let me do anything even now that I'm 18. She says she doesn't care but its obvious she does because she acts in a ""ok you can do it, but if you do ill hate you for it"" way. I can't even see my grandma and uncle will, who are in their later years. In the past 2 years I've seen them probably 7 times. I hate it. I just don't wanna live like this anymore. My family sheltered me so I'm extremely socially awkward and have anxiety doing anything remotely out of my comfort zone. So working or even walking 10 minutes down the street, i feel im going to get attacked by a dog or get hurt by someone. I've been in homeschool my whole life essentially so I have no social skills. Everything just feels stacked against me. and I feel I dont have anyone to go about it. Again, my mom hates when I do, my step dad doesn't care, my oldest brother is preachy and always compares our situation and implies what he went through was harder and he got over it, which may be true but saying my problems aren't that bad doesn't help, my 2d oldest is still immature and has anger issues and my other brother i hate, for private reasons. I've got no one. It helps to write my problems like this. I don't know if ill even post but even just writing it helps me out sometimes. I just want to be happy and not be constantly nervous about each decision I make or feel like if I do something my mom would do something again. I'm so scared to live, but I'm still scared to die.

I moved to this new city and I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do here, both study and job wise, but this ""phase"" I talked about is getting longer and harder than I expected.   
I did not get into my degree, I'm not finding a job and can't help feeling like a failure; A 26 year old guy  with no studies that lives from his parents very little money in a sunless city where he has nothing to do.

I'm no stranger to sadness, self-harm and apathy, and I'm used to emotional ups and downs, but lately, the most colorful ups go just as far as grey and I find myself wanting to cry and thinking about dying all the time; actually thinking I'd be doing humanity a favour in killing myself, since I haven't given anything meaningful to it in years, and I find no real expectations of doing it any time.

Music used to be the center of my life, but lately I don't play, record or write anything. I don't eat, don't get out of bed unless I have to.

What really kills me is seing my girlfriend so worried and I know I just need to get up and eat, spend an hour a day looking for a job, take a walk, meditate, play guitar a little or whatever, but I can't find the strength to do any of that.

I kind of hid that from my partner for a while. He knew I was in therapy but I kept it all to myself. Well I opened up about something we have struggled with and my real blunt and honest feelings about it (sex) and it pretty much ruined a lot. My truama around that is not what you think when you hear truama surrounding sex. At least not to a lot of people I guess. I wasn't raped or assaulted or anything like that, however my mom started off talking to me about sex very young but in a negative light. I had 18 years of her deeming sex as horrible, sexuality as dangerous. Think religious indoctrination without the religion. She pretty much told me the same things. I would be a whore if I had sex before marriage, blah blah you know the type. 

But bc of how she raised me I didn't go rebel with it. I genuinely took that to my heart and I think that was bc of how young she started this. I can remember being 7 years old and her saying this stuff. 

So I told my partner bc it directly affects our life. He has now told me he's afraid to touch me and doesn't want sex bc he feels like he is indirectly ""raping"" me some how. And idk how to come back from that bc he DOESNT. I actually never had a moment he didn't respect my ""no"" or anything he's super respectful about that stuff. Even before knowing. Although while working through this in therapy I've been in a literal WAR with my truama about sex so he has expressed he feels disconnected to me in that way. I'm more often than not saying no than ever before and even being turned off by touch in general and idk I feel like opening that box ruined a lot for us. Sometimes I feel like he's better off with someone else. He disagrees, bc he's a good man. He loves me but his life would be so much easier if I wasn't his partner.",depression,2021-12-05 20:31:31

354,r9grav,I am just so tired,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9grav/i_am_just_so_tired/,2,"When I was a little kid I was sexually abused.

My parents didn't know how to deal with it and tried to forget it. Never talk about it. Act like it never happened.

As a result I suffer from depression, anxiety, ptsd and bpd.

Depression is mostly like a filter that makes it hard to enjoy anything and to muster the energy to do anything productive, while constantly trying to put the thought in my head that I will never find love, that there is no love out there, that nobody loves me, that I am worthless and insignificant.

Anxiety is like a delayed response to things I experience, sometimes I go out grocery shopping and it hits me like a truck, sweating, chest pain, abdomen pain, tense shoulders, heavy breathing, using every ounce of strength from my mind to fight down the panic and get outside, get some fresh air.

Ptsd I recently learned in therapy is a huge complex of thought and action patterns in my head that my mind constructed as a way to cope with devastating trauma at a young age. 

I'm currently working on identifying so called ""stuck points"" according to a manual and trying to change my thought patterns, sometimes decade old thought patterns (I am 32 I was abused when i was 6).

The future looks bleak to me, I feel like me might have a decade or two or relative normalcy but after that we will slide faster and faster into the disasters caused by the results of climate change and globalisation.

Mass migration, new pandemics, economic collapse.

I try to think that I should do my best to enjoy my relatively comfortable life as long as I can but with such a bleak outlook why should I even get up?

Why shouldn't I sell everything I own, get a tiny house in a country where I'd have enough money to live decades without working and just do oxycodone until I die?

When I had an accident on a motor bike my arm got pretty messed up, very badly injured and they had to operate it. They gave me oxycodone 20's and it was like all this pain and fear and suffering was taken from me.

It was like I could actually exist and enjoy it for the first time in my life, at least as long as I remember.

But I did my research, I dosed down as the arm got better and stayed clear from opiods since I realised the false promise and that it would lead nowhere.

But if this life leads nowhere anyways and nobody truly cares for me, nobody truly would miss me, why not fake my death and disappear, live out a couple happy months and then decide to go... on my own terms, before everything around me has fallen apart.

I'm trying to find any reason, any reason at all not to go down that route and the only reason I could come up with is ""mom would be sad"".

But mom is also the one who didn't catch me after I was messed up as a kid, so what do I owe her?",depression,2021-12-05 19:54:11

I'm in debt, it's not severe, but it's a hefty sum. Half is credit card debt and the monthly payments kill my paycheck. 




My fridge broke. How the hell do I afford a new fridge when I'm broke and in debt? Also cant afford to eat out so popcorn is my breakfast, lunch, and dinner right now. So that'll hold me till I run out in a day or two. 




My family lives in another state and is pressuring me to take (unpaid) time off and visit them for Christmas. I'm vaccinated and so are they, so that doesnt scare me but taking time off from work does. 





I'm severely depressed right now. I'm having intrusive thoughts of killing myself, because then I wouldnt have to deal with this shit, but I could never end it that way. Though at this point if I'm on that plane going home and the engines go out, I'm one happy camper. 





I just want to get off my chest that I feel like I cant catch a damn break. It's one thing after another right now.

I cry and have a hard time breathing.

368,r9g24d,Something but not enough - words don't seem to matter but some things still demand expression (venting about my own nullified potential and wondering what the next step is),1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r9g24d/something_but_not_enough_words_dont_seem_to/,0,"After spending a couple of days too numb to remember to eat, drink or go to bed on time I made the mistake of taking some medication (all according to the doctor's orders) in hopes of jolting myself into some semblance of functionality. I just want to be able to enjoy something

I just want life to be more than this

I just want to feel like I'm not endlessly circling the drain

I just want to feel like someone wants me around. 
I want to be able to want myself around 


I should have all it takes to get better but I no longer have any idea of what the next step is and how to take it. All the things that bring meaning to life - art, friends, love - are too much to handle and i'm too much for anyone else to hold enough space for. I wish I could at least have enough self-compassion to be pleased about doing the dishes and holding on but it's too painful to know I could be cherished and am not


Instead, a cavalcade of small misfortunes and regrettable realities:
I finally get a ramp I can actually use to get out of my apartment. I finally get an aide who calls to apologise they're going to be late, rather than texting that they're not coming at all. But the the seasons have turned such that going anywhere isn't feasible much longer; covid keeps ramping up; the aide is cute but not vaccinated and recently back from the ICU for pneumonia, of all things... So naturally I'm spending the last snowless weeks sick at home, alone on every level. We'll see if I'm well again in time for the next funeral, even.


 I'm basically halfway through life and I so want to have enjoyed more than a few flashes of it..... But how? I can't even remain in my own head long enough to plan for it and nothing is helping. The psychiatrist says I've basically had all I can expect from medication. The only professional help I have is an once-a-month appointment with a psych nurse while I wait for another shot at rTMS, for some therapist to have both appointments and an accessible practice, for friendly people who will actually hear me and cooperate with maintaining boundaries and perspective rather than promise the moon and disappear


And now I'm too low again to make even a half-hearted attempt at studying, even to keep contacting therapists, out of the required bravery to stay open and seek friendship, or even to seek the self who used to enjoy things and have interests, out of energy to manage my moods, expectations, to even make sensible dietary and financial decisions


Everything feels so little and hopeless and insignificant. I need a survivable perspective but I need help

Well, I don't need to compare my lowlights, highlights, whatever, to *anything*. My life is just objectively shit.

I have a Master's degree but no job. I'm 29 and living with my parents again. We are expats in a country we've (well, they) lived in for over 30 years without permanent residency here. They are concerned about how and where they will retire, meanwhile I just want to be given a fucking chance somewhere, *anywhere*, to prove myself and put my education and hard work to good use.

It's been a year since I graduated and I am so fucking worried that any prospective employer is gonna be like, what's this one year gap, why haven't you been gaining experience? I want to! I'm just stuck on this stupid fucking restrictive visa and can't do much about it.

I don't know how to motivate myself. I've tried starting small online businesses, but the country we live in is so restrictive and economically backwards that it's hard to get off the ground. Like, we can't receive money on PayPal in my country, so if you want to do an online business, it has to be local. Which, guess what? Is much more difficult with my visa status here.

I hate that I am this age and still completely financially dependent on my family because I can't find a way out. I'm 29 and I still have to bow to their stupid ideals and choices because I need a roof over my head and can't get my own job because of my fucking visa status.

I have burnt all my bridges because none of my friends understand what this is like and any advice they try to give me has just been infuriatingly useless.

The best part is that we're not even poor or anything! They have investments, they have options, it's just that they won't let me do anything with it. We live in the same run down apartment we have been in for about 20 years, everything is broken and disgusting, everyone is miserable. Why have we let this go on so long? Why didn't they pack up and retire when they were younger? Now they're basically senile and it's gonna fall to me to wrap up their very extensive (and currently, loss-making) business and inventory and settle them down somewhere, before I can finally take control of my life.

I need to deny myself the simplest things because it's not my money and I feel like a burden, or they wouldn't approve of the purchase. *Fuck.* I genuinely feel shit having these constraints at 29.

A few years ago, I used to console myself by thinking, ""Oh well, life may be shit but at least I'm a good person"". Now? I don't know anymore, and I honestly don't care. I'd sell my soul in a heartbeat for some semblance of stability, employment, income, and independence.

Things used to be good and even though I'm naturally a worrier and a pessimist it wasn't on my mind 24/7 like it has been since the R word happened for the first time.

Essentially I was made redundant from my job and to me it was more than just a job, it was the only time I've ever been good at something and felt valued and it was the only place I felt I could be myself and felt comfortable. Then it vanished and there was nothing I could do about it and it wasn't my fault. To this day I've never understood it or gotten over it. I wish I could like other people but it's happened twice again since and I just don't know how to cope because it's coming upto Christmas and I can't afford gifts and I barely have enough to make rent. I've barely been eating regularly and I have no motivation to get out of bed. If I could go back to when I used to be happy I would take it in a heartbeat.

There have been attempts in my past but now I just feel like a shell and I wanna go into the void even though I don't wanna break anyone's heart. Today is the last time I'm gonna see my mum and I wanna give her such a big hug because I'm just not strong enough to go on.

TW: mentions of suicidal ideation and suicide.

So, I'm a young ish teen who has suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, like literally.

I'm currently seeing a therapist and taking meds regularly, and I'm definitely not in the worst period of my depression I've ever experienced.

I think I'm recovering and getting better.

But like, sometimes things are really triggering, they remind me of some of the awful thoughts I've had in the past, or some of the worst feelings. Any time I hear someone talk about suicide, and goes into deeper detail than just ""took their own life,"" I start crying and thinking about what could have happened to me, or get really defensive and snap at people. Even when it's just mentioned I start to feel sort of wrong and bad.

\*spoilers for Arcane I guess\*

I recently watched Arcane, and sort of identified with some of what Jinx/Powder was going through. Although I don't have schizophrenia or bipolar, the idea of having so much pain and anxiety bottled inside resonates with me, and some of the things she says and the way she acts hits a little to close to home (on a smaller scale). The sort of out of control spirally feeling was also there. (could be projecting here.)

Anyway, when she sort of collapses and kills everyone, I just started bawling.

Like, full on mental breakdown.

I don't really know why.

It wasn't like ""agh my favorite character died,"" it was like ""that could've been me""

Except that's not really it either.

I just felt destroyed- maybe partially because it's horrible to see her suffering but also because it felt really personal

Has anyone had similar experiences of this sort of thing?

I don't really know what to call it or how to describe it, I'm going to talk to my therapist about this but I just couldn't stop thinking about it

I just kind of wanted to jot down my thoughts and observations here so yeah. It’s just that I’m so tired….all the time. I used to be happy and full of energy but now I’m on the opposite end of the spectrum. I try to sleep most of the time so I don’t have to face reality and always kind of wish that I didn’t wake up. And no I don’t think it’s innate. Even logically it’s due to my circumstances. I’ve worked hard and smart to be at a position where I can help people, by being in one of what’s called a ‘noble profession’. This is despite me understanding the real meaning behind the phrase ‘dreams betray many but hard work betrays none’. I’ve had to sacrifice the few things that made me happy. Things like cooking, food, sport, sketching, movies, nothing makes me even a little bit happy, not even a fraction of what I used to feel when I partook in those hobbies. If the desired outcome was guaranteed after all this then I still would’ve been glad as I would’ve achieved what I wanted to, I would’ve been able to help others. But it’s still just as far as it was since before I had begun my academics. 

And all this is in stark contrast to peers in my cohort who are born into privilege, always have a safety net for them in case they fail, who get all they ever wanted without lifting a finger. They get employed for their dream job immediately after graduating while I struggle constantly for even a minimum wage job despite having the same qualifications. They have loads of friends, can go for multiple vacations with their happy families and celebrate festivals while I don’t get to visit my family for years due to international travel restrictions despite my grandmother dying. I get that life is hard, but it’s not hard for everyone even if they’re in the same category and that’s what gets me. No matter how hard and well I study I don’t get good grades (I don’t have a learning disability) and as a result I get laughed out of every university.

Not that anyone will read it anyway but I just have to get this off my chest. I seriously feel like I'll never be happy, and it feels like the world wants me to just suffer. 
This is probably gonna be jumbled but anyway here goes. So I'll start with the fact that I happened to get a girlfriend a couple days ago, and I'm happy about that. But at the same time, I have such low self esteem that it's gonna take a long while to actually get it through my head that someone genuinely likes me and wants to be with me. And it's that same self hatred that makes me feel unworthy of her, and that she doesn't deserve to have to deal with my broken arse. Plus like, I'll be going away to college next fall, and I don't want to hurt her by having to leave her (I couldn't do a distance relationship, and we want different things out of life anyway). On a slightly different note, after months of trying and looking, I'm finally in a band with people that care about the band, and we're actually making music! I take a look at my life and see that I have literally everything I've ever wanted, but I still hate my life and I know I'm so ungrateful and I absolutely despise myself for it; I don't deserve to even exist. And kinda going back to what I mentioned earlier, as far as going to college, that is a whole other issue in and of itself. Getting accepted is no issue, my grades have always been outstanding (although gifted kid burnout syndrome is starting to set in). But a lot of it deals with money. I need a car for my plans and aspirations (being in a band: I can't go anywhere with instruments without my own vehicle, and I don't wanna leach off anyone else), which means I need a job to pay for car payments and car insurance. But I can't get a job, literally everywhere I've contacted hasn't gotten back to me after months of me contacting them back over and over again. It's probably because I can only work weekends and a couple hours at night, because I do sports all year. So at this rate, I won't be able to afford a car, which means I won't be able to get a job in college either, because I won't be able to go to any job, so that I still won't be able to afford a car, so I'm screwed. You'll probably say I'm a pessimist, but I think I'm being realistic when I say that I'm only 17 and my hopes and dreams for the future are already down the toilet. I feel like no matter what happens, I'll never be happy, and I'm so sick of existing, I don't want to do this anymore. Life is just suffering, there's no point in it.
And on a side note, if anyone read this, please don't say anything about how God has a plan or how Jesus loves me, I don't believe in any of that. Thanks for trying to help, but just don't bring theology into it.
I'd also like to add that I was seeing a therapist for a bit, but I now have no time to, so yeah, that's that too.",depression,2021-12-05 10:07:10

I have done everything I ever wanted to do in this game. Most of what I've done in recent times is try to recreate what worked before, but to no avail. What happens when a person does everything they wanted to do in life? The meaning is all gone and you can only continue in this void of nothing.

It's not just one game. It's all the games. The thought of playing any game right now just sounds boring. Why bother, you know?

All of my attempts to be happy in the real world have failed, so I have no clue what to do now. There's nothing I want to do now. My favorite form of escapism doesn't make me happy anymore.",depression,2021-12-05 13:40:05

416,r99m7q,Venting about people being selfish (very long),2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r99m7q/venting_about_people_being_selfish_very_long/,3,"It's quite discouraging how so many people are selfish narcissistic snobs. What I'm about to vent about is associated with my depression in the sense that I'm keenly aware of other failing to appreciate the efforts of others when it threatens their own inflated egos.

I can approach this topic from many different angles, but I'll just focus on piano playing, because I've got similar results from several different people.

Now, I'm not a classically trained pianist or anything, but I like learning to play songs on piano, specifically ragtime compositions by Scott Joplin. It takes a week or two of consistent practice for me to learn a song, but when I do I can play it well as written. I need to have the right mindset about it, and some imagination that I might be able to perform for others. Many times when I've had the opportunity to play around others, I get a response that's like getting slapped in the face by a wet fish.

Early on when I was learning, I had gone to someone's house and noticed they had a piano and showed interest in playing around with it, but I was told, 'no, that's for my mother'. OK, I guess I can't argue with that. But that was only the first time this sort of thing happened.

One time I was playing at a friend's house on a plastic Casio keyboard and his mother came into the room and said, 'You know, I bought that keyboard so (her daughter) could learn how to play.' I don't know, that was kind of as expected coming from her. I said that I wasn't preventing (her daughter) from learning how to play. As a matter of fact, she had that keyboard for several years and seemed to have given up on playing. But it rubbed her the wrong way that I was playing the piano with the tiniest smidgen of proficiency. I was trying to encourage her son to learn some too, but I guess that toy piano was intented to turn (her daugher) into a concert pianist.

Around the same time, I was playing that same piano and one of my friend's parents, who is friend of the parents of the friend's house in question, had come into the room after I had finished playing, saying, 'you know, I used to play piano', played a single C chord and walked off. No mention of my piano playing at all. For all I know he was better than I'll ever be in his youth, but clearly didn't care that I was learning to play. But he was successful in sticking that memory into my head for a lifetime.

I was at another friend's apartmet some years later and played a little bit of their plastic Casio keyboard set up in the corner, but was quickly told to stop because 'That's what his girlfriend does.' I'd never really heard her play anything, but it is what it is I guess. This friend would never want to hear me play piano, because is his mind, his girlfriend is the only piano player he cares to hear. She was there too, and had no interest in critiquing my playing or even showing me that she could play at all. I don't know, I thought music was supposed to be a fun thing that people can share with and learn from others.

Even my own grandmother did this exact same thing to me once. She had bought a plastic Casio keyboard to learn how to play in her old age, and I was just beginning to learn too. But she told me that she bought that so she could learn how to play piano. I didn't get any praise from her for ever learning to play an instrument. I never held it against her - it's discouraging to be at an advanced age and want to learn how to do something that takes significant practice and dexterity to learn how to do. I really don't care much to share this instance of being balked at for playing piano - but my own grandmother even. It's not her fault though and it's probably more complicated than I can explain all at once.

After a while, I lost interest in playing piano. It wasn't fun for me to learn anymore, knowing I'd had so few opportunities to play for others and even fewer that would be well recieved. So I went around ten years without practicing at all - forgetting how to play nearly everything I had learned up to a certain point.

Recently, I had become interested in learning to play again because my sisters and their children were beginning to learn to play. I set up my grandmother's plastic Casio keyboard in the main room and kept it in a good spot to learn to practice. After some time of significant practice (enough to suffer from tennis elbow injury), I had relearned most of the songs I had forgotten how to play and learned some new ones too.

Then this Thanksgiving came. We were going to my sister's house where she happened to have her own plastic Casio keyboard for her son to learn to pay. I was excited at the thought of playing what I learned and maybe showing the children what they can learn if they continue practicing. But what actually happened seemed to be a deliberate effort to disregard my attempts to play piano. It was subtle, but my sister seemed to time my arrival pulling into the driveway by getting everyone to gather round and watch her son play jingle bells, and I walk in with all the family cheering for him for playing  four note song with only his index finger. I don't think there's anything wrong with his playing really - my sister (who may or may not be inherently evil) is kind of forcing him to take lessons. He's not learning out of passion for music and seems to have more fun playing with the presets and obnoxious sound effects like most kids are.

Anyways, it took me a while but I eventually sat down at the keyboard and played just about everything I know for at least a half an hour. But not one child or adult expressed any interest in hearing me play the entire time I was there. The only thing any of my family said about my playing was to tell me to turn it down - which wasn't very loud to begin with.

There was also an electric organ in the room, and when I'd sit down at the keyboard, one of my nieces would go over to the organ and play something with one finger. I eventually tried out the organ myself, never having played one, but my niece would go over to the keyboard and play something with one finger. I felt quite put down that no one cared to see me play and actual composition with two hands exactly as it was written. Ragtime is something that's just as interesting to watch as it is to hear an as it's fun to play. But maybe no one likes listening to ragtime? Maybe it is a little tacky and old fashioned. But when I hear ragtime I don't hear jingly jangly piano music - I feel a connection to the tragic artistry of Scott Joplin and the difficult life he lived.

Eventually, having gotten no joy out of my own efforts to play piano, I did put effort into encourging my niece to play and instructing her how to use more than one finger. By the end of the night, I had gotten her playing completely differently in such a way that complemented her singing ability more than just playing a melody with one finger. So I was satisfied with that, and she was happy. But what's it worth really? Everyone is so selfish. What's the point of any of this if people only care about what their doing and offer no praise and encouragement to others? So I'm sitting here playing hundred year old rags and my niece is learning songs sung by her favorite trust fund baby social media influencers, but what's it worth really if even your own family can be so disinterested in what you're passionet about?

Anyways, I have a million different shit stories about how shitty my life is right now and how I don't even care to see 2022 the way things are going now. But this is just one aspect of life feeling pointless that I have to vomit out for the time being. Just whatever. I wish I could wake up in one of my dreams and leave this shitty real life behind - I have some great dreams right now. I can write a million word treasie about my dreams too, but instead I spent the last hour writting about this shit. Whatever. My life is still just rotting crumbing around me IRL. Fuck this shit.

So if anyone actually read this, have a listen to The Silver Swan to ease your mind for enduring all of these words. It's a good song.

The same exact inventory list as today. Tomorrow you will clock in, grab the clipboard with the inventory list, and just check off the boxes and fill in the numbers. You'll see people you think about who don't think twice about you. You'll hear the same dated songs over the fuzzy speakers while stocking cans. You'll be counting the hours, waiting for your shift to end so you can go home and sleep... Just to do it again. And again. And again.  


Its fucking ridiculous. Really, how do people keep going? What do they tell themselves at night that allows them to pretend to enjoy it that I haven't tried telling myself? Where do they find the motivation to take another breath in? What makes them want to wake up in the morning? I hate to be a broken record, but humans have been asking why forever, and have yet to find an answer. We can turn on a switch and have water come to us. We can flick a lever and have light flood whatever room we enter. We have created synthesized life, and despite all of these answers, none of them are even remotely satisfying to why are we even doing this?  
   
If you can't tell, its been a rather rough day, and I am honestly not sure if I will make it to tomorrow. I think I want to, but I can't find a reason why I would want to. So to all those scrolling through going through your days, asking yourself the same questions as I am, how do you do it? What do you tell yourself that keeps you going?

I find it so difficult, it feels like there is no good option. I can just say 'nothing' and kind of laugh it off, but that typically results in the conversation going no where and the other person likely just thinking im boring. I can try to mention my typical interests, and that can work in getting a conversation going... but it just feels weird and sometimes even a bit fake. I can't help but think about how, yes those *were* things I liked doing... but it's likely been several months since then. And I rarely have any current information about those hobbies/interests.

I am currently an architecture student, I supposed one could tell me as fortunate enough to get into such difficult course. However, the truth is I am struggling a lot. Not because of the course itself but the way how university system is built, they don't accept people who refused to be in social events. I was forced to join all the social events. And there are a lot. They make me super stressed. I find myself to be shaking from time to time due to social stress. I find myself refusing to eat sometimes because I don't want to go to the cafeteria as I probably will meet someone from my course there. It's just so painful for me. People are so extroverted here to the point that they can't just leave me alone for my quality alone time. It's so tiring. Everynight I find myself to be crying. Sometimes I even have suicidal thoughts, though I can be assure that suicide is never my intention as my religion strictly prohibited the act of that. Plus, I used to be the top student at my old school but now I am no longer one, I am probably one of the worst students here. It's very hard for me to find suitable peers to share this thought of mine. At first I was wondering why did my brain worked so differently than others? Why did sadness just overwhelmed me so much?

I feel like I don’t know what I look like. When I was 17(?) my grandma took a picture of me and I snapped at her. I cried, telling her I’m so sorry I just don’t like my body and am so insecure. I’ve spent hours and days analyzing other girls. Analyzing my own features. Look at picture after pictures
 
I’ve lost and gained 20-40lbs at least 4-5 times since the age of 18. Countless diets, daydreams about surgery. I’m 179 lbs. again. Time and time again, I make a “change.”  I need therapy, medication and proper diagnosis. I struggle with depression, anxiety, CPTSD , OCD, Working Dx of BDD and undiagnosed adhd. I have an eating disorder that wakes me up multiple times throughout the night to eat.  My depression keeps me sleepy, my ADHD keeps me awake. My post traumatic stress can be triggered at random and my ocd will explode if I miss a few doses of my medication. I have to take various supplements each night and lock my fridge to avoid compulsive eating at night but due to my inattention/lack of motivation I often forget to reorder. I can research body parts and facial features like it’s a full time job.  I have distressing mental health problems. I have to take care of myself very well to ensure I stay well and live a high quality life. But I haven’t been 😞.

If I stop something it’s incredibly hard to start again

Still have weird obsessions regarding the girl my ex left me for when I was 16. Comparing myself to her and others.  

11/03 Still waking up late but productive. 

 Get drunk and then I cry that I keep seeking more and more. I know I’m not an alcoholic. I have been able to be really moderate. But this last week. I drank two drinks Tuesday and Wednesday and then one on Thursday and like 5 on Friday and I feel embarrassed and shameful and out of control again. Unless I hav rigid goals for myself like a whole month sober. (And even then I don’t stick with it!!!!) i feel like I keep failing at life. Like I can’t hit the moral standard of goodness and being my best self. I can’t reach my best self. I’m overweight and over drinking. I don’t even have fun when I drink. I’m just sad and embarrassed and guilty. I need constant stimulation. Whether it’s when I’m studying (I need music on but then have a hard time focusing so I turn it off and then I have a hard time focusing even more so I turn it back on). This last week I had a bunch of homework to do and I drank a lot more than I had been because I was avoiding it because it is hard and boring. I was trying to do things to make it better. Like listening to music and having it on in the background. I couldn’t make homework enjoyable. I couldn’t make it something I was even willing to do. It takes everything I have to sit and do my homework.  I need to be exactly comfortable in the right position, exactly the right level (&type) of background noise for me to begin focusing. MJ helps me focus but short term. Also helps me work out. I’m still sleeping in very late.

I feel stuck in my body and mind. Like I’ll never be health or balanced. I look for help online but it’s very overwhelming because everyone has opinions or advice. I can’t control myself. I’m miserable and constantly comparing myself to others. I have no interest in sex because I hate my body. I am ugly and I don’t understand my face I don’t know what I look like. I change my mind all the time on what my next venture or idea is, hoping it will make my life better.

\~\~

I have enough faith in myself to believe I’m in the right, but I think there’s always value in an outside take.   


Essentially, I’m “giving up"" on nearly everything I try, and I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t make me fee a bit guilty and lazy.   


I was let go from my last “real” job at a golf course in early 2020. As a college student, and with the pandemic, I decided not to look for work. Mid-year I took up an online customer service job, but I was in bad shape mentally and not the most outgoing person, so I gave it up pretty fast. By the end of the year I needed cash, so I took up gigging (DoorDash, Grubhub, etc.) and did that until the snow came. By then I just wanted to relax, school was stressful and against my better judgment, I took unemployment. I lived on that until it ran out mid-year this year, and I didn’t extend it. A LOT of guilt came with that, but I can't change the past.  I somehow managed to spend all of that money, because I just compulsory buy shit and that's another huge source of guilt. Anyway...

&#x200B;

I started gigging again but work was much more scarce than the previous year. At the same time, I was working on myself (in retrospect, performing CBT on myself) and came to the conclusion that I needed to drop out of college my senior year (I’d been contemplating it since Sophomore year). Yes, I could have finished it out, but I came to realize that my major was just a hobby and nothing more, and I didn’t want to waste another year of my life/take on more stress. I’d rather keep my credits and apply them to another major down the line, instead of going through with a major I didn’t want (film, btw).   


As I searched myself, I found that carpentry interested me, so after a month or so I found a guy willing to hire me with no experience. Now here’s when I really began to feel like I was giving up too easy. It was just some guy and his partner, not much of a company and I was their first employee. I was told we’d be doing mostly carpentry and trim work, but when I arrived it turns out that demo still needed to be done. On the 4th floor of an apartment building. As expected, I took on all the grunt work of sweeping and collecting the trash, doing some light demo where they trusted me to. I must’ve emptied 50 of those 32 gallon trash cans full of sheetrock. It sucked. By the end of the day, my hair was white and I was coughing up dust all night (even with a mask on). At one point the boss had me pulling nails from the wall, and by the end I was pulling up staples from the floor for about an hour. Mid-way through the day, I’m sweeping by wire and using it to collect a pile (not wanting to mess with their power tools). The boss sees me doing this and belittles me by saying (\[name\], you gotta lift the wire, buddy” in such a condescending tone it brought me right back to high school. I hadn’t felt so small in years. We worked 9 hours that day. I was beyond exhausted (and dirty).  


The next morning, I texted him saying that it was too much and I wasn’t coming back. I never got paid for that day. That showed me enough of his character. Throughout the day he had made small remarks like the earlier one, but that one in particular got to me for some reason. It really was the way he said it, like he genuinely believed I was a damn fool. I felt it in my gut right after that I wasn't coming back. I was hired as an apprentice, not a slave. I didn’t learn anything but instead carried out the work they didn’t want to do. I was prepared for hard work, not to be completely used. But I always find myself taken advantage of.  


I decided carpentry wasn’t for me, and moved on. I did bits of gigging here and there the next few months. Mostly I was trying to find peace within myself. I’ve been incredibly insecure and people-pleasing my whole life, and needed to just take some time to work on myself. I really didn’t know who I was- just some kid who pushed himself way too hard in school to impress people he didn’t like. I got tired of being weak and all that.   


Last month I decided to look for work again, something simple to get me by while I continue to take time for myself. I decided on the UPS Personal Vehicle Driver position, a seasonal job that has you delivering packages from your own car. At $21 an hour and temporary, I was ecstatic. To put a few grand away in only a short months time would be fantastic. Well, I thought so, anyway.   


After a week or so they scheduled me for a phone interview. They never called. So I rescheduled as I had seen a few posts online about this issue, and rescheduling worked for others. Still no call. I finally reached out myself and was interviewed on the spot (by a support technician?) and they told me I got the job and to expect an email with details.   


Well, I never got that email (or even asked if I accepted the job, actually), and suddenly my location had changed on my profile. There was no building address, but I was due to start that Friday. The city was decently far from me (45 mins) and I was really hoping to work in my hometown as the ad stated. Not to mention, nobody had informed me of this change. On the Wednesday before, I checked the site and had some paperwork to fill out, but still no email. On Thursday I called again and the support person told me not to go in the next day as my background check had not passed. It had been about a week and a half, but what else could I do?   


The following Wednesday I get a call from the same number- asking why I missed my orientation. I told them I had no address and someone from their line told me not to go. They asked for the person's name (as if I would remember?) and told me that my new first day was the next Monday, and I’d get an email with details (here we go again).   


Luckily, I actually did. The location was unfortunately the same, but I was ready for my first day. When I arrived, there was someone else in the same boat- and we were promptly told that there was a disconnect between the support HR and local HR- we were actually supposed to be in a town another 45 minutes away. For some reason, I accepted this and went there. It was the correct location, though the front door was locked and I had to go in through a truck terminal to find an office. Once inside, I was greeted by two rude employees who demanded to know why I was bothering them. They set me up with paperwork (about union dues and all that, despite being a contractor and not in the union) and checked out my car- all good. They said I’d be getting a call and email from someone else (seriously?)- and again, I thankfully did. This time it was for training, which consisted of 2.5 hours worth of anything but that- simple safety and policy videos, not how to do the job. I got a call the next morning at 7am about coming in for my first day (???). When I called back, I was met with loud chatter, a loud “what???”, and then put on hold 4 times before the guy who initially called me answered- and then told me to expect a call tomorrow as he was busy. Groan.  


Tomorrow morning came and I got a text- not a call- asking if I wanted to take a route almost 2 hours from my house. I ignored the text as it didn’t seem like it was for me (I had no training or anything). Hours later, another text comes from what I thought was an automated line asking me to come in to the branch I was at the first day- I agreed. The man from the phone the day before came out, shoved some papers in my face, asked me to sign one (my soul?) and told me to meet some guy at a location 45 minutes away. By this time I was ready to walk, but decided to hold out until I at least tried the job- maybe it wasn’t bad once I got going. I met the driver and told him I had no training or anything- he told me the basics, gave me a phone with the system, and sent me on my way.  


Well, the actual job was the easiest fucking part of the process. I almost enjoyed it, except for how far and unfamiliar the route was. The driver assured me that I would likely get a route in my hometown, though, and was only covering for an absence today. It was pretty self-explanatory, so I didn't NEED training- but it would've been nice. And I got lucky that all went smoothly- had their been an issue, I would've been fucked. The roads were shit, windy, and confusing, half of the houses were missing numbers, but I got it done and I can’t complain about the job itself- like I said, I almost enjoyed it. I had one undeliverable package since the address was mis-labeled on UPS’s end, and one other task undone as it was a pick-up, and the driver told me that he’d take care of it.   


I head back to the hub (as the driver told me to do, not my actual fucking bosses) and am met with an empty office. I call the number and am told to go to an OMV office- I see no such labeled place. I find a room with people in it, go in and ask- it’s the right place. A woman suddenly gets flustered asking why I have a package and where my phone is- I hand over the phone and the package, and before I can explain, start getting grilled. Why didn’t you deliver this? Why didn’t you finish all your tasks? Keep in mind, I don’t know these people and they don’t know me. They don’t know it’s my first day or anything. In fact I have no clue what department this is or what these people are doing here- half are dressed like drivers. Once they calm down, I explain and they take care of it- without showing me how to. By the end, some guy pulls me aside and lectures me on the importance of letting UPS know when I can’t deliver a package as it’s just as important as the ones that do get delivered- as if I tried to hide the non-delivery or something. Once they had their fun with me, I ask for a vest- that’s right, I never even got a vest or a badge, so I was this suspicious kid driving around an unfamiliar neighborhood slowly and delivering packages. The guy comes back with a generic yellow vest, not a UPS one, and I go home. Again, I felt so small, almost violated. Maybe mentally violated. Whatever that feeling is, I despise it with every fiber of my being. I’m beginning to love myself and I don’t need that shit, not anymore.   


The next day I get the same text- asking me to come in for the same route. I decline and go back to sleep. The day passes.  


This morning I receive no text- until about 10am, from some guy named “John” in a group chat asking 10 or so people if we want to work today. I don’t answer, but many do and ask where and when- the response is, verbatim, “Here at building at 10:30.” ?????? What building? Who the fuck are you? What route? It’s already like 10am? Am I expected to wait on a text each morning to let me know if I have work or not?   


I ignore the text and carry on with my day.   


Soon after, I get a text from the bot number (which periodically texts me things about safety and shit) using my name and asking if I want to come in today- it’s already maybe noon. I ignore it again- fuck this.   


Then maybe an hour later, I receive this text:  


“All, you're expected in on Monday and working every day, unless there are reasons that you are unavailable from now until Christmas unless there are circumstances we are aware of. Please confirm that you're working on Monday.”  


I block the number, shut my phone, and enjoy the rest of my day. I’m done.   


And that’s another job I gave up on, day 1. Well, day 45 at that point. I just feel like I have more respect for myself than to be treated and tossed around like that. I’m not bending over for these people. I don’t expect to be bowed to, but where’s basic human decency? Can I get some basic courtesy from any of these jobs or people? Or am I asking too much?   


I worked in a sort-of retail job for a little over a year, and a warehouse job for half a year. Also the golf job for about a quarter of a year, but I had no intention of quitting when I was let go (damn you COVID)- but even there, they never let me know I was let go- I just never heard back. What’s with the lack of human decency? But anyway, having those jobs means at the least I know I can put in the work at shit jobs. I don’t expect a fantastic, perfect job at my age. But I do expect to not be demeaned and belittled. To be treated as incredibly expendable, to not be treated as a human. And I would expect anyone else to have the same respect for themselves. How can you take on this work? I’m so fortunate that I don’t need need it, I’m not desperate enough to accept this bullshit.  


I should also mention that I got my first job at 17, working as an office assistant. It was a small lawn and garden place that, again, didn’t train me, and didn’t have much work for me. I was always asking what to do, and usually would get met with “clean” or “just be quiet for a bit.” Not long into it, I’m fired for “not doing enough”- which is bullshit when there isn’t work to do. They were hesitant to hire me since they had just hired someone else right before me, and I think they just didn’t need me and didn’t want to tell me. Whatever.  


This turned into a real shitshow, but so do all of my posts. Look, the bottom line is this- after reading my of-course biased story, is it me? Am I giving up too easy, or am I just constantly pulling the short straws on jobs? Even at the warehouse job, the other employees (again, much older than me) were pretty unfriendly towards me, and I kept to myself. Not so much demeaning as these other jobs, but I did also feel small there. The only “decent” job I had was the customer service/retail one, which honestly wouldn’t have been so bad if the work wasn’t. It was the only job I had employees my age and felt kinda welcome. It has its moments of disrespect, but nothing compared to the rest. While I'm at it, I may as well mention that I don't have any friends and miss working with people my age. I really took that job for granted, but I think I was also only 17.  


I don’t want to be that guy who puts in 5% and gets back nothing, wondering why. But at the same time, I feel justified in my decisions. Of course I didn’t handle them all the best. I could call UPS right now and probably straighten it out. But it’s really a principle thing for my since I don’t need the money. And I don’t really think I’m that uptight or picky- I just really think I was majorly disrespected and don’t need to take it.  


But is this just how the world is? Will I ever be respected at this age? It doesn’t help that I look quite young, too (I’m 21 btw). But it seems that no matter where I go, I get backed into a corner and take the easy way out. I have no issue quitting things- I trust my gut instinct. But when I find it going off for nearly everything I do and try, well, I can’t help but question it. Again, I do trust myself and genuinely believe I’ve always been in the right on these decisions. I’m just as deserving as anyone else, why take shit?   


I acknowledge that I could have done more and stood up for myself. But should I have to? Is the default for employers to just walk all over their employees?  


I plan on starting my own business next year- I’m beyond frustrated with the job market. And seriously, I get it. I’m not opposed to hard work. I hate coming on here and essentially just making excuses. Like I said, the carpentry job and UPS job BY THEMSELVES were fine- I let the people around me ruin it, because, let’s face it, who you work with determines how the job is. I enjoy an honest days work. That’s why I want to start my own cleaning company- work on my terms, choosing who, where, when, etc. Fuck being pushed around and belittled, I have value as a fucking human being, and I’m tired of pretending my whole god-damn life like I don’t. I’m ranting now, but even my grandparents and such make me feel small. What is it about me? Is it because I don’t respect and value myself, because honestly I never got a chance to and am just learning how to now.   


But I’d really like to hear from you now. How rude of an awakening am I in for out there in the world? The retail general-public experience I have was a spa day compared to how employers have treated me. So, put simply- is it me?",depression,2021-12-05 13:37:03

The worst part? I feel like I'm getting everything I deserve. I put myself here and now I don't know how to get out.

I’ve had SI since July and I also have crippling anxiety. I’ve been in therapy for months now and I have so many coping skills I didn’t have before . Therapist thinks I’ve made so much progress even friends but I’m just feeling overwhelmed and exhausted .

I’ve had a chronic headache since about July which means I’ve had a headache every day since then. Sometimes it’s to a degree I can manage and other times I have to just cry. Pain medicine only takes the top off of the pain.  My neurologist appointments all have been pushed aside due to other health problems I’ve had- had to have emergency gallbladder surgery - so no scans have been done of my head though I think it if we’re something serious I’d have died by now. And part of me really just wants to. My 10+ years of bloat after meals is gone now but it doesn’t matter.  

I live in an environment where it’s a bit toxic, I have no where really to go and I feel trapped. I have friends who care, but they are distant. Or they turn the conversation to their own problems. That’s ok I guess. I am on a very low dose of Zoloft I could go up but I don’t even know. Meds don’t fix a living situation- and a toxic parent.  I’ve tried so many things  (meditation journal energy medicine walking distraction CBT , DARE) and it’s just what’s the point?

I also have PMDD which drags me into a special hell every month that I can’t even cbt at all and the meds I’m on for things like that doesn’t work either.

I have no partner nor job, I wanted to play EW but this headache spiked and so I can barely play that. I have horrible sleeping anxiety and then as my headache spikes my tinnitus acts up as well. Tinnitus has been spiking due to my stress levels I know. I’ve been sleeping poorly again . 

When I do have motivation it’s just so fleeting and I’m struggling to eat. I feel like I’m dying on the inside and I cry every day. 

I have talents and things I could do but I just feel like I’m walking in mud. 

I’m exhausted to live
I’m exhausted to just be here 
I know I don’t want to truly go but I am tired of this mental and physical pain-
I want my old life back and my old self 
I am just too tired . 
Then anxiety kicks in and does the rest. 

I feel like that song “Bring me to Life” . Yes I’m 38, and I never thought I’d live to 18.

I hated it then, and I hate it now. I think it's an awful thing to say to someone, personally, though I know some say it with no ill intention.

Because I have internalised this saying, because I have been told it repeatedly since I was young, I now tend to invalidate any pain I'm in. Long-term depression? Others have it worse. Severe body dysmorphia? Others have it worse. Disordered eating? Others have it worse. Panic attacks whenever I interact with my family? Others have it worse.

This mindset was alleviated slightly when I experienced the most intense mental anguish I had ever felt, two years ago. I had just been sexually and emotionally assaulted by a 'friend' with benefits, my mom was being aggressive towards me (screaming, threatening to throw my phone in the trash, throwing things at walls, threatening to break my door down, threatening to hit me), I was barely attending any of my classes, and was having daily crying spells. I imagine this is because the 'others have it worse' intrusive thought had been pushed far enough down my priority list.

Things are better now. They're looking up. Maybe it's a guardian angel, or something, but I feel as though I've always been lucky enough never to be alone when I'm struggling. When I was a toddler, it was my sisters. When I was a grade schooler, I had a good, close-knit circle of friends. When I was in high school, I had a best friend I instantly clicked with and who understood me. Soon after the assault, I met my boyfriend.

Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious to me now that I don't have it the worst. I don't experience suicidal thoughts as often anymore, and when I do, they scare me. Two years ago, they were the only thing on my mind and everything seemed so lost to me, until I managed to make the progress that I did. Going to all my doctor's appointments, taking my meds as instructed, taking care of my hygiene, treating myself to outings with friends, I've worked really hard these past two years. And I think they've paid off, yet I still have a ways to go.

Others do have it worse. I've had it worse. But 'just a sprain' could turn into something much worse if left unattended, and I would be much more than okay with never hearing those words uttered to me or to anyone else ever again.",depression,2021-12-05 11:36:08

you get each and every point to it.

I got into 2 relationships after my first, one lasted a month. The other I honestly wouldn’t consider a relationship. (One date and 2 hookups)

It hurts, but I appreciate how she handled this situation and I shall eventually get over my feelings for her. The problem is that I feel very lonely and I shall continue to feel that way even more strongly than before, I never had high hopes and it's not like she led me on during our interactions, but a tiny part of me saw myself being loved for the first time and I felt excited. I sensed a degree of connection and mutual understanding between us and even though I don't usually subscribe to spiritual terminology and words like ""energy"", ""vibe"" or whatever, something in the way she simply exists and I have the pleasure of knowing her at this moment of my life, definitely made me feel like something special might happen.

She told me that she does not see me in the same light and that I am an amazing person whom she considers close. I do realize it is common courtesy for people to say this to the person they have to reject, but I do believe she really meant that, or at least I hope she did.

This was the second girl who I had a crush on and both times it has been a case of unrequited love. I feel really sad that I find myself unable to attract anyone and with each passing year I am starting to think that I am fated for a bleak future in which I ultimately die alone. I am not physically attractive, I may be a decent height as well as neither skinny nor fat, but God has not blessed me with a good face. I consider this same shortcoming as the main reason for my woes, used to be really angry at the universe, God, my parents, society's beauty standards but I learned to accept that it's completely natural and warranted for people not to be charmed by my face. It may sound like I am shifting the blame towards genetics rather than working on my personality, but even if I do have my vices and bad sides, a lot of people, whom I have absolutely zero qualms about calling scum, manage to find someone to hold their hand and hug them.

Lately, I've been feeling weird. It has been a few months already and there are times when I start overthinking, or something makes me feel anxious, or simply nothing really happens but I start crying. I feel bad about myself, I feel like I'm not accomplishing anything, I drink alone sometimes and I smoke to feel better. When I go out I have to heavily drink because if not I know I am boring and nobody will want to hang with me but sometimes I just prefer to stay at home and self-isolate and that somehow makes me feel worse. And I regret not going out but I know that if I start feeling shitty in front of others that would be worse so I prefer feeling shitty at home alone. It's like an endless cycle and I don't know how to escape.

I feel blue. Some bad things happened and they hit me and make me feel like I'm not worthy and most of the things I do are wrong. I don't feel motivated to do anything, I'm just waking up every day and seeing if it goes well or nah. However, there are some days where I think I feel good. Some days I'm happy going out and having plans, some days I say ""this was a good day"" and I smile and I even laugh. But other days, I simply wish I was in a coma and I wake up only when all the days are good, not only some of them.

And I don't know if it's some kind of depression or not, because sometimes I feel... happy? But the days I don't feel happy, I really feel bad.

Where to even start? I'm 15, a guy, and in high school. No, I'm not ""faking"" I genuinely have diagnosed depression by a pro, so this isn't mean crying wolf it's me suffering within my own mental anguish near every day.

I have a counselor, and on the outside, I look great, happy, and relatively good, but that's further from the truth. I'm depressed near every day, either it lasts, or subsides, but it's always there. The only true sense of happiness I get is about death, and thinking of death makes me happy, that's the only thing I look forwards to in life is either (SUICIDE MENTIONED HERE) Killing myself or waiting for something to kill me, and my only faith is that death will find me, and I will forever remain breathless. 

Near every day, especially around my friends, I feel so empty and fucking dead inside, and when I have that ""1,000-yard stare"" and they ask me if I'm okay, I smile and say yes, when that isn't explicitly true. I'm not okay, yet I act like I am as I don't want to be a burden on anyones shoulders or be an annoyance. Only a few of my friends know, and only a little know more. 

SUICIDE AND SUCH MENTIONED BELOW

On October 14th 2021, I nearly killed myself. I put a knife blade to my neck, but I was overcome with emotions, I told my therapist and was diagnosed.

November 25th, 2021, I had a failed? Attempt. I wrapped a phone charger around my neck and tied it to a clothing hanger on a door, it didnt work for a multitude of reasons in which I don't want to discuss. 

Every day I carry the burden of 2 attempts and the burden of depression on my back and no-one knows how it feels because I don't describe this to anyone or I'd be locked in a psych ward.

I need help, god.",depression,2021-12-05 10:09:20

Recently I've been getting treatment for my anxiety with therapy and meds, which has helped a little bit, but now that I'm not as focused on my anxiety all the time I feel like I've been noticing a lot more depression symptoms than normal. Granted, I'm kind of new to this so I'm sorry if what I'm saying is ignorant or not exactly right. But basically I've just been having A LOT more days where I cant get myself to do *anything*. Like normally I would feel bad, physically, cause of my anxiety so I couldn't do much anyway. But now, even when I feel ok and not as anxious, I will literally lay on the couch all day and not have the energy or motivation to get up and do anything. To the point where it makes me start to feel anxious anyway, cause I know theres things I have to do and my health anxiety tells me that laying around all day is really bad for my health. But still I just cant get myself to get up. I literally will sit there sometimes saying to myself like ""get up get up get up get up"" but I just can't muster the motivation or energy to do it besides to like, get food or go to the bathroom. It's really been taking a toll on me lately and I'm not sure what to do.

It makes it extremely difficult and nearly impossible to form any connections to the people or environment around me because I'm constantly expecting trauma or sudden change.

I hate school, I'm not in good terms with my family, like I said before I have big illnesses (I lost my left eye, right ear and my colon is destroying himself and I'm shitting blood. my inner ears make me feeling to puke) And everybody around me is just ""YoU LoOk In GoOd ShApE fOr SoMeOnE wHo Is IlL!"" I mean it's obvious I need emotional support! I'm 16 and I feel like every week that is passing is making my life worst. I feel like because of gen Z of today, I'm not at my place. Lot's of people like to tell me about their problems because I'm apparently a person with ""good advice"". But it's always painful in my heart.

For the first time in months I got up in the morning around 6 am. The first half of my day went really well and I felt productive and prideful of the work I was putting into to get my Dads Christmas lights up. However, as the afternoon and came, I felt the brain fog and depersonalization kicking in and that is when I always get the most discouraged. For the life of me I wish I could just have a clear head and just feel present, and by that I don’t meant overly happy, I just really mean focused and attentive to whatever task I may be doing at the time or person I may be talking to. I’ve struggled over the past 4 years with my depression and now it is worse than ever. Granted there are slight spurts of joy and accomplishment, it’s just that the lows are so low and I get mad at myself for the way that God made me. And I haven’t been depressed for my entire life. I had a great childhood growing up with 5 siblings and two loving parents and well into my teen years as well. I really feel like I’m stuck in a rut and I think I know what to do, but in order to do that I’m gonna have to have a lot of will-power. I don’t want to just survive/endure, I want to live and enjoy life. Overall life can be such a great experience, but I feel as if the vessel I’ve been put into is defective and fails to feel and reach the natural high that life can bring if that sorta makes sense. What’s really exhausting for me is when I’m doing something productive with my day, like today, thinking and making promises to myself that I HAVE to do whatever it takes to be productive and successful, only to fool myself thinking that things were actually just gonna really going to change.

They don’t get points for doing what they’re supposed to.

Started online dating.

All I get is hookups and camgirls.

Could have had a cam tonight. But I just didn’t fucking want to.

I just want to hold someone and watch a movie.

Barely even passing university anymore.

Hate it. Hate theatre. 

Half of them think I’m a loser because I didn’t commit to it.

Sometimes you have to do things you don’t want, but you’re not supposed to make a living off of it.

Just want to rest for a while but no one will let me.

My last therapist was shit.

Gotta wait until Monday to call the next one.

No one will help you until you’re already beyond help.

They don’t care, they just want something to fix.

People make shit ten times more difficult for each other, just so the struggle can mean something.

And the fucking funny thing is when I was out last weekend a girl I’d never spoken to before told me I am the happiest person she’s ever met. Nobody sees me, and by hiding this from everyone out of fear I can never grow. But who would read the above and want someone like that in their life? I can’t even look at that side of myself for too long and instead I have to pretend it’s not there. But it’s getting harder to do that everyday, and the older I get the worse I get. When I was young I was happy, outgoing, carefree, smart, energetic, I had potential.

I feel like such a pussy,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r94fyh/starting_to_relapse_again_i_feel_like_such_a_pussy/,0,"So, after about nearly over a year of finally getting over my depression, I feel like I’m starting to relapse again and I’m scared, ashamed, and feel like an absolute pussy.

Here’s why:

1. Intense stress from everything. Because my family and I have grown up in a poor financial situation and I would really say a broken home, but more of a dysfunctional home, I want to make sure I don’t go down that route and because I love medicine and neurology, I’m pursuing being a neurologist, which obviously takes a lot of sacrifices. I’m in at least three school extracurriculars, I’m in piano classes, I’m at the top of my class and have set the curve for all the classes, on top of this, I have work as a cashier and work six hour shifts three times a week (weekends) because of the shortage of them in my country, so I’m out there a lot and I need the money for college since my family can’t afford to give me a college fund,

2. Banned from Christmas dinner on my mother’s side of the family. Christmas should be a time to spend with family, but instead, I can’t even spend it with one side of the family entirely because I can’t get the COVID vaccine due to medical issues and even have a written exemption from my doctor. I have offered a COVID test, but they won’t budge so I’m spending it at my dads (parents are divorced), and I told my mum to have fun with them.

3. Fighting all over the place. In my life, there’s lots of dysfunction and fighting in my family, workplace (customers get into disagreements and I live in a bad area), I get kicked out of the house sometimes, and my school is a mess because nobody wants to learn and everyone is too busy being rowdy.

4. Not feeling appreciated by anyone for anything I do, I’m constantly treated like shit by most people and nobody really gives the time of day for me other than a small minority of people, who even then, do the bare minimum. Even when I work my ass off, even when I’m trying, people who do less still get more appreciation.

I just want to have everything set up in my life and be content with it all. Like have a solid life with a house, wife, kids, and a job. Fuck trying to be happy cuz that’s only temporary. Happiness will come and go throughout life, so in reality I have no control over what will and won’t bring me happiness. I really just need to be satisfied. But will I ever be TRUELY satisfied? Why do I need to be satisfied w my life? I’m gonna die so why pursue satisfaction? Maybe I should just enjoy my life. Let’s say I just do me though, what do I REALLY want to do?I want to, what I want to doNot what everyone else wants me to do, or thinks I should.I keep fucking saying “I” but what about everyone else? The people around me? You are only one compared to millions. You should be more concerned w bettering the greater good. But you can’t do that if you don’t worry about yourself. Someone who is broke can’t fix anything. Who am I to say anything needs to be fixed in this world anyway? I’m not an all mighty ruler to decide if something is wrong. Everyone says things are wrong. Who are they to say so? I don’t understand a lot of things. Maybe I should try to understand things over my life instead of just having fun? But for what? Why understand it, if I’m not going to anything with the information learned? Then do something with it then? I could make a living off it. That will get me some food, home etc. But what about my mental? What is going to make you feel satisfied ? That’s the goal here. Satisfaction. Satisfy as many people as I can including myself. I just don’t know why I need to do that though. Why pursue satisfaction if I’m just going to die? Like, satisfaction isn’t going to get me anywhere. But it’s better than being unsatisfied with myself as a person and what I’m doing. So the first part of this is realizing why am I unsatisfied w myself rn?  I got a good home, family, and friends? I went to a good school, had a decent childhood, graduated with a Advanced Diploma, and got into college. But nothing seems that “good”. Again, how could I be someone to deem this world, and my life, “good”. If you think about it, good and bad are a construct made by us as humans, just like all of our ideals. But that’s going off on a tangent, we were talking abouuuut my lifeee? Yah, is any of the stuff in my life so far been good to me? Have I really enjoyed it or just been told to enjoy these things by influential and authoritative figures in my life? Man wtf am I even talking about rn though. I wanna know what’s the point of me writing all this right now at 4 IN THE FUCKING MORNING.

I go through waves. Sometimes, most of the time, I feel “fine”. I want to better myself constructively and while I’m hesitant to say I actually take the steps to progress consistently I’m closer to taking them than not. 

But 

As soon as I get negative feedback from myself or others I spiral. And I dig myself deeper and deeper into questioning myself, and I can’t even recall what it’s about now. I dig so deep that I get to points of being afraid I’m going to snap and lose my mind. But what SUCKS is that I feel real when I’m in these states, the only thing I can ever take away from it is that I feel as if I’m sleep walking when I feel “fine” and that the episodes happen when I sort of wake up. 

Unfortunately whenever I get out of these low feelings, the thoughts are gone. I can never describe the thinking in a way that translates the emotions and honesty I can’t hardly remember them clearly either. 

Mental disorders run in my family as my grandparent has schizo, my uncle is bipolar, and a parent is dependent on anxiety meds. I just don’t understand why this is happening and it feels like I’m escalating, like climbing to the top of a cliff, the “white knuckling down the highway” line. 

I’m seeing a psychologist in a few weeks.

A bit of background: I'm a 20yo male student in my first year of university, and I don't regret choosing this path whatsoever. I don't consider myself ""lazy"": I love what I study and I've always been passionate about learning new things and do what I had to do (in fact I've always had good grades and studying for long periods of time hasn't been an issue in the past). The thing is, lately I haven't been able to find a motivation to apply to anything (let alone studying) in a meaningful manner. I have basically spent the last few months stuck at home (willingly there are no significant COVID restrictions on going outside in my country) doing nothing at all, with a crazy sleep schedule and this constant, unavoidable anxiety over my exams and my future. 

Obviously I have to do something about this situation since I have to prepare 3 exams in less than 3 weeks. I tried doing some things that kinda helped me achieve what I'm supposed to do (going to the library, trying to go outside more frequently and so on) but lately I simply haven't been able to bring myself to do anything that could help make this already critical situation better. 

I don't feel sad or anything, I just feel empty. Even if I'm worried about my exams, I just can't do anything about them. I lack motivation and I can't find a reason to do any of this anymore, and I always feel like I just want to lay on my bed and idle forever. I can't even bring myself to go out with my friends when they ask me to. 

Can anyone help me identify what's going on with me? Is this just laziness or something more? And do you have any method/advice on how I could solve this issue?

Thank you so much in advance, I hope this is not some useless garbage thread which has nothing to do with depression/mental illness. Sorry for the wall of text too, I feel like I have to give as much context as I can.",depression,2021-12-05 06:18:21

I feel like I'm ruining my life in the smallest ways. I'm not gonna give my life story. I don't have the energy to write that out right now. All I'll say is I'm 18, and I'm a first year mechanical engineering student, musician. Started working out to stop being sad, now I'm just strong and sad.

I've been staying in bed instead of studying. ignoring emails, friends, my gf. I've missed lectures, assignments, events. Have a hard time doing shit I like too, video games, films, whatever. I've felt like this for years, but it really hasn't been hitting lately. I even have a hard time writing music, which sucks, because that's like, the entire reason I haven't offed myself yet.

I feel fuckin terrible for lying to my counselor. Tuesday, I told him I was busy working on a group project. It's been finished for a week. I was just scared of going to the session. I still haven't read his reply.
Haven't showered since Wednesday when I went to the gym. It's Saturday now.
I'm going to fail my classes. I know I'm going to fail my classes. I'm not sure how many, but there's a 90% chance that I fail at least one.
That's all that matters now and I've completely sabotaged myself. Jeopardized my own success, really.
I just don't know where I can go from here. I've done nothing and I'm still out of options. Kinda ironic.

I've had 3 sessions so far with a counselor and I really struggle to tell him anything significant. I don't talk to anyone about my emotions either. Cried for the first time in years at the end of the first session. No reason either, just happened. Next two sessions I didn't say much either. I know it's only making it harder in the long run but I just feel so guilty and I hate talking about myself.

I'm not diagnosed with anything, but since looking shit up and being recommended ""a nice to get the blood flowing"" by every goddamn website in existence, I been wondering, what's the fastest way to get through what's holding me back? Meds? Cos exams are in a week, I'm really running out of time here and idk what I'm gonna do if I don't get through university. First term of first year. Jesus fucking christ that's pathetic ain't it. 
But I think I'm also scared of having it turn out that there's nothing at all wrong with me, and that I'm just a lazy fuck. That's the worst case scenario. Definitely an ego thing.
See, because it's exam season, I don't know whether my suicidal thoughts are because of my laziness putting myself in a bad situation that would make anyone suicidal, or if they're because of something else and just made worse because of my poor academic situation.
I'm just really fuckin scared.

Maybe if doesn't help me it can another. 
      To fully understand you'd need to read my biography. But I'll try to provide the basic jIst if it all that has me in this position. My 47 years up to this point have been mostly gut punches, failures, lies, and exploitations. I can't trust much as a result including my own jaded outlooks. Im literally all alone and isolated mostly by choice if honest after losing so many I loved to death or others addiction. My home thou paid for is falling down I can't afford repairs and it's environment is detrimental and I need out of it, so in away I don't want to invest a thing in it.  
     I grew up with a very sick mom and eventually dad after her death. He remarried and the new bride stole everything I was supposed to have received including the land my house is on. By law I may can save it but it's took years to legally do which I'm now arriving at.. it requires funds I can't get. Due to other past mistakes and exploitations that I allowed . 
  Before mom died I got married in away to let her have peace more than for my future. I'd even thought of divorce upon her death. I never actually wanted to get married have kids etc. Well after mom died in just a couple months my daughter was concieved. I was a emotional wreck I took it as something it wasn't and tried to make it work with a woman who'd become dependant on me and refused to help instead become a addict a thief and made everything worse but not before a second pregnancy with my son. I eventually threw her out kept kids for 3 years untill she got sober. Then I allowed her to get them I had no one to help me I lost job after job because they kept getting sick and I'd have to stay home as daycares or schools wouldn't keep them so I could work. Doing so allowed me I thought to at least help provide ex never has worked since births. So I chose no state order to give a check a month to help care for them. I wanted to leave this state but can't as I feel I'd abandon them so I sought away to stay I had a house but not stable income. To get that I went back to work for my bro in laws company that I started with but had to leave when mom died as sister went crazy and legal actions had to be taken to protect my father. I literally was leaving after sitting here jobless carless for 6 months with fries ends headed out west when told that morning they'd pit me to work. Thou I was paid less than I had been in 15 years doing my trade..this was about 5 yrs ago now. Since I've gotten back to what I was paid and if honest in many ways have it made. Yet I know people I've trained have been placed in positions over me. Several make more than me thou non have my decades of experience I never miss a day. My only vice is cigarettes. Financially I can survive but I can't save not is a second job much of a option as hours vary widely In my primary job. As a result I sit at home on weekends knowing I need to be doing but have no motivation to do. I have 20 yrs left to work I have zero retirement I have a failing home structurally I have legal fights I have to fund to get anything I should have been given,   that prevents me from leaving the failing home or the state takes the property.  I can't leave nor can I see away to increase pay that I shouldn't be having to even ask for from a bro in law that has no alliegence to me as my sister is dead and he's a widow with millions thanks to what we started  im just lost I'm stuck I couldn't survive if I had rent or mortgage to pay. I can't leave or state takes my land. I can't find away to raise the funds and hold some sense of dignity when literally 10k would solve and provide me with assets I should already hold. A raise isn't likely as I'm told it'll get better I have a future that never seems to arrive at the hands of the one I helped get rich that lives across the driveway and sees daily my struggles. Now's I live in a house that roof leaks no heat no ac. Electricity out in half the home even. I can't afford to repair or to leave . I won't bring my kids here to stay the night even I'm embarrassed. 
  Now that's just a tip of the iceberg but how can I find hope that in another 20 years I won't be dependant on the state likely living in govt housing and a monthly SSI check. It's either I fix these issues post haste or I won't have time to prevent it. And it my future us only getting older sicker likely living in that state barely surviving still if I can as medical cost will likely increase. Do I just ghost out and try to build elsewhere which odds seem against being successful and to do so means I leave it all land to state, kids to ex, stability thou not compensated adequately ,for a chance that could literally leave me homeless and worse off and even more alone. Or just accept this is my existence suffering is my best friend I'm only supposed to eat once a day. I'm supposed to be living as I do in squalor am I supposed to have no pride I myself or hope in what I can achieve. And if this is what I'm supposed to accept then why exist at all. Why only suffer till I die in ever increasing ways when it's already this bad. Is life worth living without hope joy self respect love if self and others and relationships with others that are seemingly exploitive of what you can do for them. What is life if to weak and powerless to live and make changes required when needed.. It can only condemn the existence to come afterall  so why wait why experience that. I think I seriously need mental health attn. But would I if I could alter some external situations to my benefit. I don't think so I just desperately need a win. I've had nothing but loses for almost two decades now. Both parents ally siblings my two longest life friends my wife, my inheritance if half a million and home land etc. Career being stalled by those that I trusted to help me have a better future so I could be in my kids lives in a manor that didn't destroy my self worth.

Forward to this summer. I finally started meeting some people, started having friends, met some girls.
Things were going good for once. I really believed that I would be happy this time. But 4 months later and everyone hates me and I have no idea why.
All my ""friends"" just stoped talking to me, ghosted me and said they ""stoped feeling it"". The same with the girls. We talked, went out, and one day out of nowhere they just stoped talking to me and ghosted me for no reason one after the other. Now if it was a case of no chemistry, or if we didn't really click or something I would understand. But I had fun with everyone up until the point they cut me off. We used to have so many laughs, and I was always feeling so happy with them, I even told them so many times how I felt when I was with them. They meant alot to me. And suddenly I'm hated among different groups of people.I don't get it. I keep asking but no one answered me as to why they hate me now. I'm just left in the dark.
I just feel so fucking played and a fucking clown.
Now I lost everyone and everything again.
I feel even more depressed than those past 7 years and I don't know how much more I can take.

Like someone put a filter on my pupils.
I’m so scared I look to my family for comfort and something is weird they are not as familiar as I remember.  My anxiety is so bad it feels as if my entire torso is one giant void. When I look in the mirror, the person looking back at me offers no comfort, my eyes looks so glossy I’m so scared I feel like a prisoner in my own body, like I know something I’m not supposed to like I’m not supposed to be on this earth. But most importantly of all I don’t want to feel like this for the rest of my life. I can no longer see my future the days are one blur nothing matters.

It became 10x worse when my live-in boyfriend of the time dumped me via text, while we'd been talking about going on holiday the day before...I was shattered. I hadn't seen it coming and I truly love(d) him. Unfortunately, he has refused to speak to me or have anything to do with me since. We've never even spoken about why he wanted to break-up. The only thing he did was make a list of all the things that were my fault (aka Every Little Thing).

I was raised in an unstable home. I haven't spoken to my dad in 6 years, and I guess he doesn't miss me either. He has ignored me since I was a child.

This week my mom told me my dad raped her repeatedly when they were married. I have barely slept since. I knew my dad was a nasty person, but I didn't know he was a disgusting criminal. I hate him so much and just want to hurt him, make him feel our pain.

My mom doesn't want to talk about anything anymore. I guess it hurts her and I understand, but I'm so sick of holding everything in so I don't hurt others. My mother is the most important person in my life, but it seems like we can't talk about anything anymore.

I feel so lonely, I don't have a support system. I haven't seen or spoken to anyone all week.

And I don't know if any of these things makes sense, but I'm suffering so much and I just want it to stop. I feel like I've tried everything: medication, therapies, in-patient care etc. and absolutely nothing's worked. I think the best thing for me would be to die. 

I am a 32 year-old woman and I have lost almost everything that mattered to me. The issue is I can't trust people anymore and that's why can't keep on living. I'm so stuck. The only thing I ever wanted was to start my own family, but depression and trauma have shattered this dream.

Our relationship has been pretty rocky (I have relationship anxiety and have obsessively doubted everything about us and have broken up with him a couple times in an effort to get my mental health back together, but we keep ending up back together again). I have also been feeling pretty emotional and get upset over everything and I feel like I’ve been dissolving as a person. I feel disconnected from myself, like a blank personality walking around. I’ve lost my sense of humor and care for pretty much everything.

My SO doesn’t really hang out with anyone else or go anywhere, and if he does it’s for a short amount of time and they just play cards or something. 
He asks me if I want to hang out almost every day (which I appreciate) but most days I have been saying no. I feel pretty guilty about it. And if we do hang out I’m just straight up silent and ignore things he says because every time he speaks I feel pressured to respond to things that he says (when he cracks a joke or shares an opinion, etc), it irritates me and I shut down. Often I’ll just end up on my phone while we chill on the couch, to distract myself from anxiety. I feel really rude, when we used to hang out before we moved in together I never used my phone with him. But then I remember that I am in my own home, and just because he wants to sit on the couch with me I shouldn’t have to put my phone away? so idk? 

I told him why I feel this pressure (I have had family members that would take my quietness personally and get offended if I didn’t laugh at their jokes or follow their imaginary script). He has ADHD, and said he understands and doesn’t need me to reply to things he says, but that he does need company/a sounding board basically at times when he is feeling hypertalkative or otherwise he’ll feel like he’s going crazy.  

I have told him so much about myself, more than I have anyone else. I’ve told him so much actually, that I feel like my mask has been ripped off and he knows too much about me, and there’s no point anymore of trying. He can probably now see how empty and fake I am, and can tell that I fake laugh 99% of the time and have no real sense of humor. 
I would hope he would put the pieces together, but I feel like my silence is pushing him away.

Would you not feel pretty awkward and pressured if your live-in SO asked you to hang out every day? I mean I appreciate it but I feel bad saying no when I just cannot bring myself to stay engaged in conversation even if I try, and when I’m drowning in insecurities.",depression,2021-12-04 18:44:47
602,r8qgn1,My life just turned around,5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8qgn1/my_life_just_turned_around/,2,"Hey yall; 
I have to share this with someone-

I have been suffering and fighting and losing to depression for as long as I can remember. I lived in an abusive environment, like many people that exist these days.
Education was a huge source of pride for me throughout my life. I was really active in the school curriculum. I didn't hate other kids but I had this weird sinking feeling whenever people looked at me, my mind would blank, and my heart would start beating. So I was awkward of course and only had a couple friends. Learning though--- THAT was what I went for. I loved school. It was better than home. 
During the summer of 9th grade, I went to my friends home in the town over for a week. Another story made short- my mother had left and moved out of the city while I was away. She f***ing abandoned me. My stupid as* told the school and they said I needed an address to attend. So I found an address- then they said I needed a guardian- couldn't find one of those- and my friends dad was not in a traveling condition being a paralyzed man. So that didn't work- they said try when you're 16 so I started tracking that b**** and got emancipated (she moved to the other town by the city) -I was 16 at this point anyways. Then guess what?? They said I was too old.
Because i was on welfare at the time, they told me to try alternative education- so I went and worked my ass off to catch up to everyone else and then circumstances changed again. The small school closed. I gave up on myself completely. School was a source of pride for me and the depression sunk in. At this point I was 'living' with an abusive boyfriend. (That's how it always goes right)
That was 12 years ago and having been heart broken since. (Also literally ran away from that guy with my cat hahaha (Who I still have :3))
My life had been a complete mess.
These past few years have been really hard. My mother died from alcoholism, then my stepfather died 3 years later from lung cancer. My brother overdosed and died. My friend had a baby, and I'm happy for her, over the moon! But I have no one anymore.
I held pride in being an educated kid and when I lost that chance, I would attack myself for not being better than I am. Why do I suck so much? I couldn't even finish school! I'll never measure up to who I dreamed of being.
So I am working a monotonous job that I lied to about having high-school-like everyone else-, every single day and give up. I attempted to ride the sewer slide and failed at that too. Because at this point I had a cat and a GOOD boyfriend. Damn life lines.
But I still needed my life to end somehow. So I said eff it one day and applied for college. It was the weirdest and biggest and scariest decision I ever made. Ever. I just dont do that kind of thing.
Yesterday I got my highschool transcripts back. So obviously I checked them. And checked them. And googled everything I could think of to combat what I'm F***ING LOOKING AT
Reddit. I did it. 
I did it, I got my diploma. I got it when I was 17, before the school closed. Reddit. All I want to do is scream in joy and humility~
I have beaten myself up for many things and school was one of them. Every interview, everytime someone brought up high-school, everytime I reminisced on projects~ 
I was proud of myself then~
And I haven't felt this way since- 
AND I DID IT WITHOUT HER
GOOD RIDDANCE!!!! 
Depression will sink in again, but atleast by then I'll be in school, or doing a job I feel worth being there for.
Thank for anyone who read. I haven't been this happy in a long, long time. I could live here in this feeling forever, and even I cant- right now it's worth it.

TL;DR: I got my mother fu**ing  high-school diploma Bish-nut!!!!!!!!",depression,2021-12-04 19:41:52

Today I was listening to a podcast that my once best friend had made, until I ghosted him on his birthday, we had gone to high school together and became almost brothers and he had my back through some of my darkest times. In fact he was the first person I told about being suicidal. Then this past august he had a birthday and I really struggling and ghosted him and we had already been on shaky ground because I would disappear for a few weeks at a time but it’s been Months now and I still haven’t messaged him. Now it’s to a point where I don’t think I ever can unfortunately and it’s all because of me and my inability to control my emotions. 

But back to today, I was listening to his podcast that just so happened to feature my Ex of two and a half years from around the same time we had become friends. They new me sometimes even better than I knew me as cliche as it sounds. It’s so strange because I haven’t spoken or even thought about her in years especially sense now I’m happily engaged to the love of my life. Yet when I heard her voice for the first time in years it was like I was out in a transe and as I sat there for two hours listing to the two of them laugh and talk about their lives and how much they have changed it felt like I was right there with them, it brought me back to one of our parking lot conversations and I’m not sure if it was nice or if it was torture hearing what was once the two most important people to me laugh and be filled with happiness knowing I’ll never have those kind of laughs with them again.

I think the part that hurst the most is that I’m the one that separated myself from them and the excuse was the same “I’m depressed and on a relapse so to speak, I don’t want you to get caught in the cross fire”

I’m always the one to initiate and even then, people bail. They choose others over me. Every single time. I make fun of it, take it as a joke but honestly it fucking hurts. To never being someone’s choice, simply option 2 or 3 or 4. I’m never asked if I wanna do something. I always have to be the one to initiate, the one to bother everyone, the one to feel like a burden when all they wanna do is simply have fun. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I’m just fucking lonely.
I try to take others‘ weights off their shoulders, making them feel a little bit of joy, asking how they are, checking if they need help. What the fuck is wrong with me to not get even the smallest tiny little piece of recognition in return? Why does it feel so wrong and bothering to do what I’d want someone to do for me. It’s just the little things. Like asking if I’m okay. Like wanting to hang out. But when does that ever happen, when do I not have to invite myself? It’s so fucking lonely.

We are trying to get out but so much stuff keeps coming up and it feels like an endless cycle. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that one day it will all change and I can have my life back. I've made alot of mistakes I regret in my life and it haunts me so much and today especially I'm just in a really dark place. I dropped out of college so I could work at a pizza place and spend more time with my boyfriend when I was 19. I had a baby on purpose when we weren't financially ready. I dont regret my son just the timing was off and it got me stuck in this situation I can't get out of. I have so much hatred in me I can't work because I have to drive my husband's grandma around everywhere all the time and I have no one to watch my son at night. I miss working so much and I hate what the world has turned into. I have intense hatred for my father I can't bear to hear his voice. I'm just so pissed off all the time and want my happiness back. This Christmas I feel no joy I told my parents I dont want anything for Christmas. (There was an altercation that happened a couple months back that ended it for me) I no longer want anything from my father. Thank you for letting me vent. And please dont tell me you should try and find your own place I am highly aware of this. Good luck to all of you out there suffering keep pushing through.",depression,2021-12-04 22:08:41

I have to choose? So I am choosing to be suicidal and depressed?? And she was wrong about the doctor discharging me cause he said: “we can not let you go home” thank god cause I’m really not safe, but it felt very invalidating when she told me she thinks I should just get home treatment.

For Context , I am not depressed - but someone extremely close and dear to me is suffering from what I believe to be depression of some sort.


After a long conversation with them , I finally managed to get a somewhat understandable picture of what maybe going on in their mind

They say they feel like a constant burden on everyone else around them , and that - they somehow don't deserve to  exist - they also say that they frequent suicidal thoughts , but as of yet haven't acted upon them.


What makes this so difficult , is that this person does their level best to put on a very stoic demeanor all the time , and thus they tend to bottle up with emotions and have breakdowns , which seems to happen every month or two 

The reason why I'm telling you guys this is because I assume this is the best place to get advice on this topic - I have sought out medical care for this person , but it must be noted - that They , nor I can afford private therapy - so they have been put on a waiting list for the NHS and are due to start therapy sometime (march) next year - which is a long way away.


I want to know how I can make this person's life easier - as it is hard to get them to say or divulge details about their mental state , so perhaps you guys could give insight on a level beyond anything i could pick up?",depression,2021-12-05 03:17:02

He says that he can’t be with me because he is depressed, he will only bring me down and that I should move on. This all happened so suddenly because I never saw this coming nor had any idea he struggled with suicidal thoughts. He was diagnosed with clinical depression and intermittent anger disorder and has constant suicidal thoughts. He is going to therapy twice a week and is currently on medication. After some conversations he says that he doesn’t regret the break up, that he loves me and that even if he gets better he probably will want to still be alone. He’s also going out a lot, hanging with friends, drinking, and talking to other women. He’s been honest with me. Right now I am his “friend” (his request), but I love him and hope that we can find our way back together. We’ve hooked up a couple of times and still talk here and there as I am the only person who truly knows and understands him.

When covid started, I was on meds. Due to covid I had to move multiple times. Now I live in a very expensive area bc it’s where my partner is from, and I can’t afford meds. I’ve been off them for nearly two years now I guess. 

Things seem to be getting worse every day. I didn’t realize how bad things were until my partner said something. I have no desire for anything anymore. I have hobbies but I feel so few emotions anymore that just thinking about them is exhausting. I can’t draw anymore, I don’t care about DND anymore, I used to hike all the time. I live by the ocean, and I used to dream of living in an oceanside town. Now that I am, I just. Don’t care. 

It’s affecting my relationship too. I love my partner, but depression consumes me.

Where I live, it’s so much work to get benefits. It overwhelms me and I shut down. I know I need to just suck it up no matter how bad it feels to push through it, but god it’s hard. Everything is so hard. I had the realization last night that if I didn’t have the life I have currently and if I were in my previous situation pre-covid I’d probably be dead.

That was such a scary thought. I’ve been depressed my whole life, but I’ve never attempted nor thought very seriously about it. I had things I cared enough for. But realizing that if I suddenly lost what I have, I’d have nothing. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for here. I just needed to post this somewhere. I have no therapist, and talking to my partner only helps so much. Plus I try not to dump all of this on him. I’m just tired and I need relief but I can’t afford it.",depression,2021-12-05 02:45:36

About half a year ago my father found a new wife since my parents were divorced. At that time before he married he would ask me would u still talk to me if i found a new wife? At first i was like nah are u out of your mind u aint marrying. But later i was like aslong as its a good wife and makes you happy but i dont wanna get to know her. So he married her and since he married her he didnt spend asmuch time with me he didnt call me asmuch he used to help me with my books and shit financially before i started working he stopped doing all this. His wife didnt want him spending time.and shit with me. At that time i was angry at him so i stopped talking with him for  awhile and he said he would make a new kid with her a kid that would listen to him i was like whatever but this wasnt the first time we stopped talking to each other. We always beef then we make it good again. So we made it good again but about 3 weeks ago i stopped talking to him well i talked to him but i didnt answer his calls asmuch i didnt spend asmuch time with him as i used to not like i spend time with him alot before but less... either way i told him to not call me because he only comes to me or calls.me if he feels like it. I was just angry just because he calls me or comes to me once a week or once in the 2 weeks if he wants to. What kind of dad chooses his wife over his son and whenever you beef with your wife you get back to your son. Anyway thats how i felt maybe it wasnt like that maybe he had his own problems clearly. 1 week passed away i was working at a late saturday my father came to my work randomly i wasnt expecting him.. He asked my colleagues if i was working and they said yeah he told them if they could bring me to him that he needed to talk to me privately. So my colleagues come to me tell me my dad is here i go to my dad and i tell him im working this isnt the time to talk right now and he smiles at me and is like alright ill wait for you outside tell me when you finished. So he goes outside i finish my work he waits about an hour for me and when i finished my work i straight up took my bike and ride away with it towards my house. He went after me with his car and honked a couple times to me but i ignored him then he called me and was like we need to talk we cant be like this but i told him to go home and leave me alone. On my way home i saw my 2 cousins i went with them to buy some shit at the supermarket and i think my dad saw me too and he went home dissapointed. The next sunday he calls me about 10 or 15 times i dont answer. The next day.... Monday i was working out from 14:00 till like 16:00 he calls me alot again like usual but around 14:30 he messaged me son take good care of ur family and sister be a father i love you but i didnt read it at first else i wouldve called him instantly or go to his house... when i finished working out i went home and my cousin called me. She never calls in 17 years this was the first time i was like what the.... So i call her im like wassup... she tells me to call my other cousin its something about your father... So i was scared i thought it was something with his lungs or heart since he smokes alot of cigarettes so i call the other cousin (her brother) but before i called him i read those messages and i already had some feelings so i call him and he tells me if i am alone im like yeah why whats wrong he tells me to sit and get a glass of water at that moment i knew... Then he told me ur father died he hanged himself i didnt believe it why the fuck would he do that i thought he was kidding i thought it was a plan my dad made up so i would talk with him again. But it wasnt... So after i heard that i instantly called my mom and sister i told them to come home instantly it was important i didnt tell them on phone i was scared something would happen while driving home... so they come home i tell them what happened they didnt believe it either but it was true. Later that day we went to his house. Whenever someone commits suicide detectives have to research if the suicide was out of the persons own will or if the suicide was forced by somebody or whatever. So they didnt let us in and my father lived in like a flat where u have 1 small door at the bottom and if that door is open u could go up to his room. But the detectives didnt let us in they said we had to wait for the research to be done but i was i was stresses and wanted to see my dad so i broke that door and i went upstairs to see my dad but the officer took me outside handcuffed me for 10 mins and cooled me down and let me go so we waited outside for the research to be done. And we saw a few neighbours walk by while we were crying they knew someone comit suicide because of the police and detectives. So this one old woman came to us and told us that she was my dads neighbour. She told us my father was a good man always happy but he always beefed with his wife everyday. She said his wife was never good to him and the day before todat (sunday) his wife hit him outside while they were argueing apparently they always beefed but the neighbour said my dad never layed a finger on her. That my dad is a good man but the wife killed him and it wasnt just her 2 or 3 neighbours said the same thing. So about an hour passed away i went outside to get some fresh air but while i was outside my dads new wife came in. I wasnt in there but my mom and sister were still waiting for the detectives to come. So his new wife came in and was straight up talking shit. She was like how did this happen... omg... my mom was like yeah we should ask you that question since you live with him. She was like yeah when his son and daughter dont answer the phone he would go mad.. So she tried to blame me and my sister from what i heard. I come in and i wait with my dad and sister i see her looking nasty at me im like the fuck you looking at she is like nothing. So my sister tells me the story about how she is blaming me and my sister. I told her what the neighbours told us and told her if she would talk wack one more time about my sister i would kill her she got all red and apologized either way fuck that bitch. So We waited about 2 hours and they came downstairs told us that my father hanged himself out of own will and it wasnt forced suicide. They told us if we wanted to we could go inside and see the body. So we went inside they told us he was in the right room. I go in the room first i see my dads body laying there in the bed his eyes closed i see the strains around his neck from the rope his body was so cold i couldnt believe it i kissed him i didnt wanna let him go but my mom pulled me away then i his wife came in you could litteraly see her fake crying it was so obvious... fuck man so we wait for the people to pick the body up and bring him to the mosque since in our culture you gotta wash the body and in 3 days he gotta be burried. So while we wait my cousin comes in brings me my dads stuff as memorial. Hes a good guy honestly he is the only guy that has ever been there for my father when he needed him and to be honest he been there more for my father then myself probably. So while we wait i ask my cousin what happened the told me my father was fine he didnt seem depressed or stresses at all in the morning he told him to give this.money to me since i didnt talk to my father he gave him a rack for my driver lessons since he wanted to help me. So my cousin was like alright will do so my dad and his new wife beefed again at work that day thats why he was home so early. So he messages me with i love u take good care and messages his new wife and his sister so my dads sister read it at first and got scared and called my cousin (her son) to take a look at his house to see wassup. So my cousin tells me he went to his house but nobody opened so he called and messaged him he didnt answer so he calls the neighbours and tells them he is afraid something happened and asked of they could.open their door so he could climb trough their balcony to my dads house. So he did that and when he opened the door he saw my dad on the wall... he saw the body and the rope and fainted at first. He called the police after that then he called me and thats how it happened.  Yeah so he told.me what happened and we waited for them to pick the body up. And while we were waiting his new wife started talking about money and said they always put money on this table that someone stole it. Like we give a fuck about money.... like what... my father dies and she thinks about money... i mean its obvious she never loved him she litteraly only.married him so she could have an european passport since she lived on turkey... struggled there and met my father and used his money... either way fuck her so they took the body next day we washed him he went to turkey and we burried him there. Thats pretty much what happened.
I feel bad i blame myself for him comitting suicide. If i knew he would have had this much stress and depression because of his wife or life i wouldve even lived with him but i didnt know i ran away from him i avoided him like an idiot child... everyday i live with regret and it doesnt go away whenever i think its getting better i think about it again. He would always tell me to go therapy he would always tell me that he is my father he would never want anything bad happen to me he would want the best for me. I didnt take him serious. Sadest thing is he never went to therapy himself while he told me to go.i shouldve went to therapy together with him if i only knew damn man fuck me... But on the other side this isnt the first time that i beefed with him and didnt answer his calls my brother also passed away 3 years ago because of an mental ilness and my dad kept going in life he marries 6.months with some random and this happens... my father and mother were married 30 years and beefed every week and nothin happened i dont know why he would do this all i know is i havent been there enough for him. Whenever he would tell me to come to his house to hangout or outside to a bar to chill or whatever id always say no no no id chill with my own fake ass friends smoking weed and beeing a junky instead of chilling with the actual guy that need help and actually cared about me i made alot of mistakes and i live with regret everyday do you guys have advice for me or people with experience on how to move on?..

I've been a teacher for about 8 years now and my job is literally killing me. Thankfully, I've recently put a resignation on my boss' desk. At least I had enough bravery in me to do that. Sorry if I'm rumbling, English is not my mother tongue.

Anyways, I don't know what to do next. I feel like there is nothing waiting for me out there. I feel super lonely in my marriage, I keep getting lost in my past (I've had it rough, I guess. I was adopted into an abusive family, my step-father was a raging alcoholic. My step-mom died just 2 months after I had given birth to my son. I've been depressed ever since. No, actually, I've been depressed my whole life, now that I'm thinking about it.)

I can't get my shit together and I don't think I will ever be able to. My husband is out there taking over the whole world (and I am really happy for him, he deserves it) while I waste away, having no goals, no passions, and constantly crying about everything. Just walking out of my apartment and looking at people's faces makes me mad for some reason. I don't fit anywhere, it's just as if I was transported here from another planet. Sometimes I look at the night sky and just wish I could go back wherever my true home is.

I can't end things. I would never do that to my baby boy. He's autistic, he needs me more than anybody out here. So I'll stay.

last year it was mostly about free will and drove me to my darkest point yet, i thankfully mostly got over with it and began to cope.

but now after overthinking and becoming paranoid again i’m struggling to come to terms with what is real and what isn’t. things such as solipsism and the simulation theory only make this worse as i now have breakdowns and lose sleep unable to come to turned with anything and i’m not even sure if i’m real or the people around me like family and friends are either. it’s so bad where any kind of comfort i try to get from it or any kind of reassurance i see as my brain trying to trick me. i haven’t seen the sun for three days because my sleep is so messed up and there’s not much light where i am right now. i want to seek help but i can’t have a therapist and people around me don’t understand how serious it is for me and how badly it affects me.

i’m not self diagnosing myself with anything but i think a good way to describe how i feel is that i am suffering with a lot of symptoms from derealisation. This is all leading me deeper and deeper into a dark spiral that i feel trapped and lost in and the only way out seeks to be to take my own life which i doubt i will do but it plays on my mind a lot as a way of escaping this. 

i guess i just feel alone and i needed to get this off my chest to something or someone.

647,r8td0m,Question about Dopamine reuptake inhibitors,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8td0m/question_about_dopamine_reuptake_inhibitors/,1,"I have this weird phenomenon that whenever I experience a release of dopamine, be it through an orgasm, drinking or weed, I feel fine for half a day, but then my motivation and mood plummet for at least 24 hrs. Stuck in brain fog. My speech is noticeably worse (limited vocabulary, quieter, etc.).It can take between 3-5 days for me to feel leveled out again. I hardly ever drink, and I quit weed years ago. The orgasms though… that’s just a cruel neurotransmitter game my brain is playing on me.

I’d love to understand the mechanism with my dopamine release. It doesn’t get released when I work on projects that used to make me feel good (and still would if I didn’t procrastinate them). Instead I go for the dopamine rush and as a consequence need 3-5 days to be back at baseline.

This year my psychiatrist put me on Sertraline (an SSRI). It was supposed to help with social anxiety, lower cortisol / prolactin and give me the motivation to work of an ever-growing stack of projects I’ve been procrastinating. But Sertraline took away any remaining motivation and made me bed-ridden for the entire summer, even on the lowest dose. I slowly quit it after 8 weeks and experienced all the negative symptoms from brain zaps to upset stomach to increased sweating. I’ve tried other SSRIs over the past 15 years but none seemed to benefit me, and all gave me side effects.

Should I give Wellbutrin (Bupropion) a try? I used it twice over the past two decades but no longer have records on why I quit them. I recall not having sexual side effects on it, but perhaps it made me more irritable / anxious. Is there perhaps another medication that is more geared on dopamine reuptake inhibition and less so on norepinephrine? My social anxiety and general high-stress exhaustion would probably go into overdrive if I keep more norepinephrine in my system.",depression,2021-12-04 22:05:04

34m, never in been in any sort of romantic, or sexual for that matter, relationship and have barely had friends in the past. I’ve allowed my social anxiety to mutate me into this unapproachable bitter caustic monstrosity that now whines to you all. I’ve come to expect nothing and hope for nearly as little, because what can you actually say to someone like me. 

I’ve done nothing with my life and have no real desire for anything that isn’t fleeting. I used to have hobbies but now I don’t have the energy for them, they feel like a chore and aren’t fun anymore. My waking hours are filled with work at a soul crushing job, come home and watch some tv show I’ve seen a billion times or if I’m feeling “ok” video games to escape this reality. If I’m not doing either of those, I’m simping over some cam girl or content creator and jacking off. There are plenty of days when I’m not even really aroused, and I still rub one out for the mere seconds of a dopamine release. Then when I’m finished I abhor myself even more and grumble to myself facetiously “and you wonder why no one likes you…you’re a creepy bastard in his 30s that lives alone and spends his time pulling his pud”. So pathetic. Worthless. When there are people with actual problems and tribulations, this is what I worry about, what keeps me awake lying in bed. 

I’ve said in the past the only thing keeping me here are my parents. Couldn’t do that to my mother as she’s quite the bleeding heart. My father however passed earlier this year and I couldn’t even muster any tears. Likely worst of all is now I’m just counting down the time till my Ma goes, so I can finally depart myself and not bother anyone. 

Accompanying the social anxiety is proximity issues, I can’t stand people that get too physically close to me all the while craving emotional and physical affection, a catch 22.

I know there are things I enjoy such as cooking, or hairdressing (but only as hobbies and it's a shame not to utilize my mental abilities into university studies, especially in such a competitive job market). 
I also like nature but I drifted away from it since I couldn't mentally handle chemistry or physics or anything like that anymore, even though I somewhat liked these too.

Everything I do feels futile, I'm so miserable right now it's taking a toll on my loved ones mental health and I can't take it.. I can't even make decisions about the most unimportant small things in my life and every day is a decision-making hell because I over analyze the outcomes of my decisions and how it can affect my life. It has become pathological at this point and I feel severe guilt about spending money to the point I don't want to shower for too long, or eat too much, or  spend on petrol or on clothes.. 

I hate the fact that I'm ranting right now but I'm at a point in life where I feel so fucked up that I can't just say hey forget about it and go on with my day because it's the same dull routine of staying at home due to basically not having any friends, let alone the spiraling covid situation which is stressful enough...

659,r8s6gg,Imprisoned,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8s6gg/imprisoned/,0,"For the last few months I've begun to feel like I'm in prison. I don't do much of anything and I barely get out of the house.

&#x200B;

My only time out is therapy, which is once a week, and shopping. Neither gets me out for any substantial amount of time. 

&#x200B;

I've been going back and forth over getting a job inside my head but it just feels like so much. I haven't worked in over 10 years so getting back into the workforce isn't going to be easy nor will it be fun.

&#x200B;

It's just another cell for me to rot in, right? Getting a job? Because then I'm bound to stay at that one place for however many hours, however many days a week. It's still a prison.

&#x200B;

But I think about it a lot. I live with my brother and we both collect SSI so we're fine in terms of money. We both are minimalists so neither of us need much of anything.

&#x200B;

But if I could just get over this, get myself to commit to getting and keeping a job, we could move wherever we want! I could get us a car for the first time, we could go camping and fishing again. There are many benefits to me getting a job. I'm well aware of everything I gain if I can do this.

&#x200B;

But I also lose a whole lot too. I can't just sit around staring at the walls anymore, even as much as it is driving me insane, it's still something I know I'll miss. I won't get to play games much anymore, having a job might interfere with my therapy, and I'll be expected to actually show up and do work.

&#x200B;

There's a lot to be said, but for the life of me I can't commit one way or another. I can't just get up and expect to get back into work and at the same time I can't stand sitting here, just wasting the day away, locked inside this prison cell.

&#x200B;

I'm still locked inside that room, I've always been locked inside that room. For 30 years I've been locked inside that room. Nothing has ever changed that. It's almost like I'm meant to die here and suicide crosses my mind daily.

&#x200B;

There truly is nothing left out there for me. Nothing new, no new adventure, no new experience. Just more of the same as always. Unless I can get myself off my ass and pit that door to go find work.

&#x200B;

I'm at the point of making the jump, but I'm so scared. Even admitting that to myself brings tears to my eyes. I don't know so many things and here I know everything, because the answer is always the same in this prison. Which makes it comfortable, knowing what to expect and what not to expect.

&#x200B;

Life is never easy, but I just need a break from this. It never goes away. I just want to stop feeling like this. Like no matter what I do, I'm still locked inside that room after all these years. Like I'll never break free.

&#x200B;

All the answers are there. The only thing left for me to do is jump. But can I? Will I? I'd like to think that I'll do it. But everyday that slips by is another day that I've just stayed here. I know I don't deserve this. I know I want more from this life.

&#x200B;

Like I said, all the answers are there. I've gone over them a million times inside my head if not more. I just can't help it, I can't help wasting away here. It's in my blood.",depression,2021-12-04 21:09:05

677,r8va51,I came to a realisation tonight.,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8va51/i_came_to_a_realisation_tonight/,0,"This will be a bit of a longer post, as I need to get my thoughts out. Sorry in advance if it breaks any rules.

So for context I moved out of my parents home a year ago, to a capital city that my best friend lived in. I love my family but I needed my own space and to be around people that I chose to be around for them, not just their proximity.

However, somewhere along the line, I started making dumb decisions. My friend, god bless her soul, invited me into her friend group here, and I got along with everyone great, and they accepted me as one of their own. Problem is I work a full time job from home and they were all uni students in their last year, and I had no other social life. Schedules never lined up and I never had any life events in common with them, so more and more I found that as everyone had to commit to their studies, I was at home, alone, for weeks on end, with no one to talk to aside from work colleagues. I haven’t been in a relationship in years, and have made no real attempt to fix that.

I started spiralling, and towards the end of this last term, I essentially went 6 months where I only saw my friends a couple of times. I also have been struggling with job satisfaction, and a lack of hobbies, and generally just slowly losing my personality. I tried therapy around the middle of the year. It helped for a short while, but I ultimately gave it up.

I think the worst part is me and my friend started arguing more and more as the year progressed, when we never had before (this really hurt me, as I knew I was fucking up but didn’t know how, or how to stop, and I hated myself for making their life harder). I never knew what to talk about when we hung out, and I will never understand why she kept putting up with my boring ass when we stopped clicking. This was the one person I’ve always trusted with anything, and I was fucking it up.

Now I’ve never been suicidal, as I’m shit-scared of what may come after, but recently I found myself constantly wondering how much better everyone’s lives would’ve been if I never moved here. How I could just start walking one day, and that no-one in my life would know until work realised I wasn’t working. How much fun everyone would have if I wasn’t putting a damper on things.

It all culminated in the last couple of weeks. I finally had a chance to start hanging with my friends again, but each chance I fucked up somehow. The first, I just tried to hang with just my friend, but for her own valid and personal reasons, she wanted to invite others, first from our friend group, then just her bf (who for the record I get along great with). I declined both times because I didn’t have the energy to deal with more than one person. This led to a misunderstanding over whether I had an issue with their relationship, which was so far from the case I didn’t know how to react.
Then we hung out the next weekend with one other friend, after talking things out, and it went great. But then we made plans to hang out the following week, and I again fucked it up by assuming her valid reason for maybe postponing our hangout was because she was politely wanting to not hang. Again we talked it out, and hung out. But it ended on a weird note, and I spiralled for the next fortnight, barely eating or sleeping.

Then today happened. There was a party where our group and like two other groups were all going to hang out at a park for Christmas. I bowed out, claiming overexhaustion and a headache (which was true but exaggerated), when my real reason was I didn’t know how to react going from no interaction to a 30 people party without being depressing, despite it being my chance to finally see everyone again. My friend again commented that it sucked that I was missing out on a chance to be happy.

I made myself have dinner, and fell asleep watching YouTube on the couch. When I woke up, it was like a switch was flipped. My friend was right to be confused. “Why did I make an excuse not to see everyone, when that’s what I wanted more than anything?”. And I realised that I’ve been my own worst enemy, sabotaging any chance at my own happiness, and bringing everyone else down as a result. I sent apologies to my friends, confessing my dumbness, and am yet to hear back (which is fair given it’s the middle of the night).

So I guess now I need to figure out how to be happy again, how to be someone worth being friends with. I want to be better so bad. I don’t know what I’ll do if I fuck it up again. But how?",depression,2021-12-04 23:35:25

I used to mess my brain up with all kinds of drugs and I was in a very toxic relationship filled with all kinds of abuse. The drugs fueled my derealization and my visual snow which didn't go well with the depression. I eventually reached out for help and my parents and myself, with the help of therapy and mostly medication, got me rid of depression. 

Now almost one year off the medication I yesterday got a random feeling similar to back then, except without the derealization part. I'm trying to stay calm since I really think that the feeling will be gone within a week. And I know this sounds a little weird since everyone gets sad every once in a while, I do too, but this doesn't feel like that, it feels almost exactly like the depression from back then. 

I have done almost everything to stay sane recently and everything in my life seems good. I have a girlfriend who I love and who treats me well. I have been working out every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday consistently to keep my stress levels down and it helps my overall mental state as well. School and its studying have never gone better and I have routines that I rarely ever break. 

So how does this happen? Has anyone felt this random mood shift in a quite perfect time of your life? Could there be a reason for it or is it totally random? How would the brain slowing the production of them happy chemicals have any benefit for me? If anyone wants to share any similar experiences or if anyone has any answers to my question I'd be happy to listen.

683,r8jcqf,My only goal in life is to ghost everyone.,8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8jcqf/my_only_goal_in_life_is_to_ghost_everyone/,1,"Back in the summer of 2018, my uncle randomly called out of the blue to inform me his wife had passed away not too long ago. The both of them had been a pretty big presence in my pre-teen years, taking me under their roof when my dad couldn't keep himself together. So, he called to talk to me the first time in years and asked if I'd care to fly down to Florida for a reunion and funeral service. Of course, I said yes. Because it wouldn't have been so bad to see family that I didn't inherently associate with my childhood traumas. However, I am and always have been a reclusive basement-dwelling nobody. No car, no job, no money, no state ID. No real will to live.

This caused a few hiccups, obviously. Couldn't really book a flight from MD to FL and board it without any ID. I told him as much and he went out of his way to send me $60 to help me with the process of obtaining an ID so he could then book my flight. This was in early August of that summer. Come September, I had spent forty of the sixty dollars on marijuana in order to self-medicate the depression away and told myself I'd use the other twenty to get my ID. Tried to do some of the necessary steps by mail, only to learn that MD no longer allowed certain things to be sent by mail. Like a new social security card. So, of course, my depressed ass said screw it and just stopped trying altogether. Stopped worrying about it, stopped talking to my mom about it, stopped answering his calls.

At the time, I didn't have a phone or working number or any sort of sleep schedule so he was only able to reach me through the home phone, which my step-grandmother pretty much handles herself, from the hours of like midnight to three a.m. This eventually caused a fight between her and my uncle because he kept calling and I kept dodging his calls, and in response, she blocked him. October then rolled around and I received the news via other family members that he had been admitted to the hospital, which prompted me to call him myself and finally talk to him. He assured me everything was fine and that it was nothing serious. And I fed him a whole bunch of bullshit as to why I was never really around to take his calls. 

Still, he persisted on the idea of getting me to Florida and I agreed, stringing him along on some more bullshit.

That conversation happened around the end of October. November came and I sat on my ass, just daydreaming about dying. Doing nothing to make it down to Florida. Then December came and nearly passed, and it was the day after Christmas that I received the news that my uncle had passed away. The same year as his wife because it turned out he was sick and wasn't improving. 

So, essentially, I ghosted my uncle for nearly half a year until he, himself, became a ghost. And now this entire year of 2021 all I've been hoping and praying for ( after a third failed attempt ) is that maybe I'll die the day after Christmas, too, due to health complications I've been keeping from my immediate family. 

It's literally all I want for Christmas. The simple gift of no longer existing would be the best thing to ever happen to me. And every day I hate the fact that I even lived this long. I just want to be the corpse I feel like I am most days.",depression,2021-12-04 11:50:05

I suffer from depression but I overcame it for a long while and did fine. I'm always doing very well and I am not depressed at all when I am single. But always when I meet someone I get depressed. Now I am in a relationship that seemed very good in the beginning and I, myself, was doing well. With time I sinked into my depression. Now we fight a lot and mostly because I always find a reason of not being happy. Sometimes her reaction is also not the best one, but maybe she's just sick of my reasons to fight. I end up overthinking how bad this relationship might be and in the same time asking myself if the relationship is the problem or me trying to sabotage my relationship because of my mental state. 
I was done with therapy, but I will start again next week...
Anyone else struggling with something similar?",depression,2021-12-04 14:02:34

I have multiple reasons that I've mulled over for weeks;

1.) Very difficult to fit it into my timetable. 

2.) I'm not finding it very useful. So far my therapist has pretty much said that my response to situations seems completely rational for the situations I've faced.

3.) If anything I'm finding that I am feeling worse consistently since starting. 

4.) I'm not gaining anything new. He talks to me about how my issues link together but I was already fully aware of how the different cogs in my life slot together. I've never shyed away from thinking about my life and talking to my husband.

5.) I genuinely don't think he could suggest anything that would actually help me. A big issue of mine is I feel like my days roll on and on and I just exist. I do the same things every single day and that is basically just childcare for my autistic daughter and baby son. I can't make changes to my routine because it wouldn't work with my autistic daughter. Until they're at full time school age, I can't change anything.

Has anyone found that therapy just wasn't useful to them? It just feels like a burden between arranging childcare and the way it makes me feel for when I have to go back to look after my kids. At least before I could fake a smile to play with my kids until they went to bed but I'm finding myself just sat disassociating the day away now.",depression,2021-12-04 16:03:18

I can't have normal conversations. I can't enjoy anything anymore. Except for scrolling through all of these threads aimlessly. 

My fatigue has reached it's all time high. I just want to sleep all the time but my body won't even allow me to do that properly.

I got put on gabapentin 8 years ago and I think it numbed a lot of my mental health problems, also with marijuana. But this year I feel like I have slipped into a nightmare. I view life differently. I feel very disassociated and feel like I'm watching a bad movie about myself.  I feel different, mentally and physically. I lost my mom when I was 17 and I feel like I am grieving her again, and also grieving thinking about how much different life would have been for me if she was here. 

I live with my Dad still who drinks a lot and doesn't have one comforting trait about him. He actually wasn't even there for my my mom when she got sick with cancer.

My brother moved away to Colorado. I have one grandmother left and an uncle. But it seems everyone else either left or died.

I have one close cousin but she doesn't really understand what I'm going through

I do have a boyfriend but I don't feel like we connect sometimes and it sucks cause he actually does try hard to cheer me up and is very sweet. But sometimes I just feel like I cannot connect emotionally with him at all. He's had a pretty good life, not many hardships. I feel guilty for feeling like this when he's the only person who actually makes sure I eat something 

I actually reached out to my old best friend (who had sex with my ex boyfriend after I broke up with him) out of desperation because I miss being happy and who I used to be. This obviously didn't help, but going to stay at her house for a little while felt ok. Her mom bakes muffins, lights candles, makes her home a real home. While I was there I just pretended for a second or two that I belonged to something like that. Even though I don't and I have to return to my dad's house where everything is falling apart, and quite empty. Makes me think of the memories I had there as a child. These thoughts physically hurt me to think about. These thoughts make me want to have the balls leave and hope that after you die, you get to go to a place where you actually are happy.

This drug gabapentin just adds to the despair now as longterm use causes depression and a plethera of other side effects. I can't even quit taking it cause it gives me akathisia and I get even worse with anxiety/depression. I wish I NEVER started taking it. My mental health isn't built for these side effects...

I graduated nursing school last December and I thought I was gonna be in a better place. Now I'm a complete mess, I feel alone, I just miss my past (it's literally all I think about)

I just have this deep deep need/want for family. A home I can call a home and feels like one while I battle through this. My ""home"" doesn't exist anymore and it breaks my heart. I can't stand seeing people's family's together anywhere (I'm just so jealous) it hurts

I feel like no matter what beauty shit I do, I'm just fucking ugly after all.
Basic hygiene, getting my acne under control, going to a hair stylist instead of chopping my hair short impulsively. 

The only thing I don't do is wear makeup outside... I use mascara and eyeshadow sometimes but I never leave the house like that. I still don't look good enough. I'm scared of judgment. Because the other students never see me with makeup. I'd be center of gossip. I don't want unwanted attention. 
I'm also afraid my lashes will fall out if I use mascara daily...

Secondly...
My friends all look better than me. My best friend is underweight and I love her body. So tall and skinny. I'm not overweight in any way but I think I'd look better if my bones showed more. I'm short so I always look fucking fat in anything I wear.

It hurts that whenever they post something on social media they get flooded with compliments of how hot and beautiful they are.
But I don't get a single fucking compliment. People avoid to get to know me.
People never tell me anything nice.
Why do they meet up with random boys and immediately have luck? I'm so sad. I'm ugly inside out.

12 hours a day, 50% of my life. That's how long I have to allocate to ""sleep"".  I need to allocate 12 hours per day to ""sleep"" in order to *maybe* get 4 hours of sleep per night. 

I've done it all. Sleep studies, sleeping pills, CBT, exercise, meditation and masturbation, no meditation or masturbation. I've done it all down to the minutiae of when I bathe as it might affect my circadian rhythm. 

You know what I learned from all that? Nothing. My ability to sleep appears to be entirely random. Sure, being stressed makes it worse, but it's still random. 

Anyway, I'm just throwing this out there, in to the void, for no reason in particular, because I already know it won't help. But I know there are others out there that are in the same boat, this small leaky boat, that understand. Those semi-functional adults that have to allocate a full 50% of their limited time on earth to just trying to get enough rest to stay alive. 

I'm throwing this out there because there are others out there like me.

714,r8n9ei,"Need advice please- TW: rape involving minors, suicidal thoughts",2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8n9ei/need_advice_please_tw_rape_involving_minors/,2,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I(17f)didn’t know which sub to post this on so I posted it on quite a few. I think I was raped by my (now) ex-boyfriend(16m). I would like some clarity on what I should’ve been on the lookout for or if I could’ve stopped it from happening. Basically how much of it was my fault. I’m sorry if it’s long. (TW: sexual assault)

&#x200B;

We met when I was 16 and he was 15 towards the end of 2020. I had just shifted apartments and was in a terrible place mentally. I had cut all my friends off and was very depressed and suicidal. He shifted to the same apartment a few months later and we met through a mutual friend. I find it very hard to connect with people so when we hit it off immediately it felt amazing.  I wasn’t looking for anything romantic with him initially because he was younger than me and I wasn’t keen on the idea, but we quickly became best friends and knew that we started liking each other. I was very against dating because because I felt like I wasn’t emotionally ready and he said he was too. We started kissing and making out and soon after admitted that we had feelings for each other on call one night. He asked me why we aren’t dating and I told him that it wouldn’t end well, and that the idea just icks me out a little. But he kept being like why not, and to have some faith, so I agreed. Mind you, I really liked him at this point so I was willing to give it a shot. 

&#x200B;

I’d never gone past 2nd base before and he’d already had sex so it wasn’t as much of a big deal to him. Before we started dating I gave him head which I guess gave him the get go that I was ready to do anything. Since we lived in the same apartment we met everyday, and after that day he would kind of expect it everyday even when I just wanted to kiss. I was a little surprised at the beginning but I thought it was normal and I didn’t want to disappoint so I went ahead with it. He’d also constantly turn every conversation we had, especially late at night, into something sexual even when I made it clear that I was uncomfortable. I’d give in every time because I didn’t want him to think I didn’t like him, and tried to convince myself that it was just because he liked me. 

&#x200B;

I should’ve realised then that he wasn’t educated about consent, but I was so blinded by how much I liked him and how good it felt to have someone with you 24/7 that I told myself that these were all normal things to expect in a relationship. I had an abusive childhood too so love seemed different to me than what it may be for others. I told him I wanted to wait and that I wanted my first time to be special, be it with him or not. He said yes absolutely and many things which made me trust him further, although his actions showed otherwise. 

&#x200B;

My friend(16f at the time) was groomed by another guy in our friend group(19m at the time) into hooking up straight after her break up. He knew that she was a virgin and that she expected only making out, maybe 3rd base max but penetrated her without asking for her consent. It happened in the washroom of a common building in our apartment and soon after she told our friend group. Him and I talked about how horrible it was, and he said that it was awful and how disgusting it was for him to do something like that. I was glad he felt that way. Not even a week later, he takes me to the same washroom.

&#x200B;

We were looking at his old childhood pictures before that, and laughing together. It was a nice night. He told me that he had to go home soon and to go to the washroom with him. I thought making out can’t hurt and went with him. We kissed, and before I knew it he had taken mine and his clothes off. All I remember is everything moving super fast. I was on top of him kissing him when I felt that he was trying to penetrate me. I told him that I’m scared and that I wasn’t sure, but I thought it must’ve been a mistake because we’d already talked about it. And he himself had said that he didn’t want me to lose my virginity to some quickie in a dark washroom. He didn’t ask me if I wanted to. Before I knew it he was inside me. I just remember feeling completely numb. My mind was frozen in some sort of icy shock. Screaming what the fuck is going on what the fuck is happening. I didn’t make a single sound. I didn’t say no. I let him continue. I just wanted it to be over with. Towards the end pushed me off him and shoved my head down again. I resisted by lifting my head up once, but once he pushed again I gave in. 

&#x200B;

He got up and handed me my clothes and started dressing himself. I still remember exactly what he was wearing, what I was wearing, the feeling of clutching my clothes to my chest in that dark dingy washroom. 

I couldn’t speak. He realised something was wrong when I couldn’t speak. He helped me get dressed and kissed me on the forehead and asked are you ok? I didn’t say anything except push him away. I could tell that he was getting scared. What’s wrong he kept asking, over and over and over. Whatever I tried to speak came out in whispers. I didn’t realise I was whispering until I saw him lean closer and closer to catch what I was trying to say. He kept trying to hold my hand. I was so heartbroken. I trusted him so much. I felt so dirty and disgusting and violated. I felt like the one thing that was truly mine in this world had been taken away from me for 5 minutes of someone’s gratification. I dropped him home.

&#x200B;

I was so confused. What had just happened? I called my younger sister(15m) before he got into the lift when I realised my voice hadn’t come back so he took the phone from me and told her that he thinks he made me sad. He went home. My sister and I aren’t close but we have this kinship in the fact we’ve been through the same things together. That was the first time I hugged her in my life. I sobbed until I was sore, and she did too. I told her what had happened. I didn’t feel like myself anymore. It felt like the last, hopeful, part of me had been ripped away. Like my heart had been ripped away from my chest, beating and bloody till it eventually stopped. I told him not to tell anyone. He messaged me saying he’s such a terrible boyfriend and that he is so sorry and that I should stab him if it makes me feel better. I scrubbed myself raw in the shower that night for what felt like hours trying the get the memory out of my skin. 

&#x200B;

I’m going to spare you the details now. But after this I broke up with him after a couple days, he insisted that we should still be friends. I didn’t want to lose him. Losing him at the same time this happened would’ve felt like 2 tragedies at once. We started dating again barely a month later. I wished that he would leave because I didn’t have the strength to. I had no space to myself. He told me he understood that what he did was wrong and that he loved me. When I asked him how could someone who loves someone else rape them he said he thought I wanted to. And that he thought I said I was scared and I don’t know because I thought someone was outside. I comforted him because he felt bad about raping me.

&#x200B;

He told me he’d get panic attacks when I talked about it which made me stop because I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. Then he’d ask me why I don’t talk to him ab it. I was the only one who believed him when he said it was an accident, a mistake. Deep down I knew it wasn’t of course, like everyone else, but I was so blinded by the temporary comfort being with him provided that it just didn’t matter. I wanted comfort from the person who caused the pain. I was so lost.

&#x200B;

It was still very rocky with intense highs, and much more intense lows. But the highs were so addictive. He’d get mad when anyone suggested that our relationship was toxic. We were on and off because my friends knew about what happened and made me break up with him, but I always went back. I slept with him again too. He still pressured me but this time I told myself I’m doing it because I wanted to. There was one day when I was sobbing thinking about it in front of him and he just smiled and told me to hit him. To get it out. He kept trying to rile me up. I didn’t want to hit him, I just wanted to cry in his arms. Him smiling in that sick way did something though, and it felt like a fog had been lifted. I told my friends in the apartment and they begged him to leave me alone. He said if she wants me to I will. I knew that he’d leave me once he loves me if ever and that I’d leave once I love myself. Being with him after was some kind of self-punishment. He knew about my problems at homes, and with my mental health, I’d never, ever been so exposed and vulnerable to a single person in my life. The one time they ask me to trust them and I do it ends up like this. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, we don’t break up but his parents find out that we’re together and being quite conservative, lash out. I finally got some space from him. No contact whatsoever, and I realised that I had to break up w him. I texted him that we need to go on a break and soon after that we need to break up. He asked to meet irl just to say goodbye. I wanted to see him one last time and STILL somehow hoped that we’d be on good terms. We talked to 2mins and then he kept trying to take my mask off (pandemic), I let him and we pecked. Like a goodbye, thanks for the memories peck. I must seem very stupid and I was, but I’d give anything to get that naivety back. After that, he kept trying to makeout with me and touch me. I didn’t freeze this time. I said no, and I pushed him. Multiple times. I said stop and put my hand between us. Moved myself away, told him to please sit down. He kept going. It finally dawned on me that he was never sorry and that he’d never understand. That I can’t put myself in harms way to protect other people and make him learn, because he never will. He pushed me tried to force me to go down on him and I screamed fuck off which was when it finally hit him I guess. He sat next to me. I didn’t know what to say. 

&#x200B;

He didn’t say anything either. He fell to my feet after a while and started sobbing about how he didn’t know what was wrong with him, and that I deserve better and to please forgive him. I lost my voice again. I made him promise me that he’d never hurt another girl in his life, although the promise probably means nothing. I went home. My friends mom found out and was going to tell his and I, stupidly again, told him to tell them himself because it would be better if they heard it from his mouth. I didn’t want him to get punished I just wanted him not to do it again. He told them only about the recent time because apparently they would’ve blame me otherwise. He was still trying to convince me that he was looking out for me. I asked to speak to his mom and he refused. I asked him to tell them about the first time and he said I’m sorry, I love you but this is the most I can do for you. I can’t ruin a life long relationship with my parents. 

&#x200B;

I told my dad soon after. It broke him. He’s abusive, but I know at the end of the day, he does want what’s best for me. He asked me what I wanted to do and if I wanted to go to the police. After I told him the whole story, he essentially blamed me for going back to him. And that if I was really so disgusted with the first time why would I go alone with him afterwards. I didn’t know how to explain. Hopefully, I’ll be able to tell my therapist and she’ll explain it to him in a way he’ll understand. 

&#x200B;

I still miss him. I know it wasn’t real but I miss him so much. I don’t know how I’ll ever be normal again. I feel so unlike myself and broken.

I’m so mentally tired of dealing with the anxiety. Before the pandemic, I already suffered from OCD (Health ocd and contamination OCD), PTSD from traumatic health event, depression, anxiety and panic disorder. So this was the WORST thing that could have happened.
So what happened? All of the progress I’ve ever made? Destroyed. I don’t even want to leave the house anymore. And what’s worse is, I have a severe needle phobia because my family has passing out risk. Brother has pots and mother has severe autoimmune disease that makes her faint without warning. I’m so afraid getting vaccinated because of the needle. 
And it’s not as easy as “I just have to want it bad enough”. My needle phobia causes me to almost react out of my own control. I don’t like it but because of my PTSD, I can’t control these almost involuntary moments and responses.

I have a remote job, so I don't socialize at all. Even though I have a good job and I'm doing well financially, I do not feel happy at all.

I have seen all my childhood friends get girlfriends and get married and have fun and be happy. I am 22 years old and I feel like I wasted my teenage years, and I feel like I am wasting my twenties. I have never really felt happy with my life. I have never gone out and had fun with friends or done any of the normal things that teenagers and people my age do. I've never been in a relationship either.

I find it really hard to make new friends. I am very insecure, and I find it very difficult to speak with women. I know that I am not and ugly guy, but I cant help feeling anxious and insecure when I see a woman I find attractive.

I have been feeling extremely lonely since 2016 when I moved out of the country I grew up in, but I have reached a new low.

A few weeks ago, I decided to meet with a prostitute and lose my virginity. The experience was nothing like I thought it would be. I was not able to mantain an erection due to anxiety. I have been seeing the prostitute every couple of days, and I always find it very hard to mantain an erection and to feel any pleasure. The sex has been terrible, but the worst part is that I have caught feelings for her. I can't stop thinking about her and it makes me really sad to know that she has sex with other men and that she doesn't really care about me.

I know that falling in love with a prostitute is an extremely stupid thing to do, but I cannot control it. I have decided to block her number and not contact her again for my own sanity, but I have been feeling extremely down and extra lonely.

I feel like I have reached the lowest point in my life. I feel like such a loser for paying for sex and losing my virginity to a prostitute. And I feel so stupid for falling in love with her.

“I don’t want to do this anymore.   I’m so tired. 

Life’s been nothing but failure and regret for 27 years. 27 years of unhappiness, loneliness, mistakes, regret. I’ve been putting on a brave face and pretending to be okay, but I can’t anymore. Things aren’t going to magically get better, I’m a failure at everything. How can I honestly believe that after 27 years things are going to start getting better now? I have no one.   I fuck up every friendship I’ve had, never had a legitimate relationship. I try everyday to get better and to be optimistic, but I’m running out of things to tell myself on why it’s not working. Who wants to be friends with someone like me? Who in their right mind would want to date me? I’m an ugly 27 year old with the social skills of a rock. I care too much and overthink every fucking thing. I feel like I don’t deserve anything good and that anything good that does happen is only because of luck or pity. That every person who talks to me only does so out of pity, boredom or because they have no other choice. I’m stuck on repeat, everyday is the same, go to work all week,  try hard as hell to get through the weekend. Rinse and repeat. Do you know how fucking hard it is going to bed every night and waking up every morning knowing that you don’t mean shit to anyone. That if you didn’t wake up, no one would care, or even notice. That things would probably be better if you weren’t around. Your co workers could get more work done and become better employees without you, your friends wouldn’t have to deal with you every day and would be happier. Your family doesn’t have to worry about inviting you to stuff that you won’t go to anyway because you’re too depressed to do anything. Wishing you could go back and fix all your past fuck ups. That girl you loved and messed everything up. The friends you slowly stopped talking to because you weren’t in the mood and they gave up. 
There’s things in my life I’m thankful for and I take it for granted everyday and I hate myself for it. 
Where did it go wrong? 

I’m just so tired. I wish something would go my way for once. That I would have something to look forward to, to keep my going just for a little while.. but I know that’s not going to happen. The best part of my day is when I finally go to sleep, after hours of delaying it because the minute I get into bed I start overthinking everything, or because I don’t want to have any dreams. Dreams that are so good and make me happy, until I wake up and realize it was only a dream and that it’s nothing more than a fantasy. Finally, after hours of this, I can finally go to bed.

We’ve been preparing for months and we just finished TEN shows in the last four days. I was so good, I was getting so many compliments on everything I was doing, a lot of ppl thought I was a senior (usually the seniors do better than the freshman), and one of our directors even told me I would be  going places if kept up my good work. 

But now that it’s all over I feel so empty and so dark. I’ve had depression for years and I’ve never felt so alone before. I feel like I’m in a puddle of disparity darkness.

We both work full time, we both contribute evenly, our bills our paid, there's food in our fridge. I have an inheritance in my future, it's nothing outlandish but it's more than most people get, I have help with a down payment for any starter house I choose. I even have a job interview next week. Why does nothing ever feel right then?

I have inescapable anger and rage. Over the most minor of things. My fiance and i constantly fight over nothing because once I reach a tipping point I'm blinded by anger for days on end. Full days where I see my toddler less than 5 minutes a day because I don't leave my room. You remember the beautiful ones in the rat experiment? That's how I feel most days. 

Alienated. Exhausted. There's no role for me other than to just be 'dad' and it's pretty arguable she could have a better father with most other people anyways. Adoption or not. My partner and I grew up without both parents, I know the life of hell that comes once I dip. But is it better for her to listen to me get yelled at than not, just so daddy can still be 'around'.

I won't blame this all on covid, but I finally decided to try and seek professional help. I work from I don't see anyone except my daughter, my fiance and her mom. I rarely leave these four walls. I don't have friends or people I can call up and rely on. And besides, that's not fair to them that I only want to hang out when I have a problem. I'm great friend when the effort is put in, but I can't expect other adults with their own lives to live to cater to my attention needs. I can get telehealth through my EPA, but I don't want that. It doesn't feel right. I need to be a setting not my home and between work and logistics I don't have anywhere else I can be. 

I feel like I never grew up past 15. That the worst of my teenage angst has stayed with me forever. It's not that I can read others emotions or my own, or that I don't know how to react to them appropriately. But I just don't. When I get mad I shut down, get quiet, seclude. But like a bear hiding in the cave, if you coming poking and agitating me I will blow up. I guess that's just bottling up my feelings then huh? I have no support system to put them out there anyways. 

And even if I get help, I've brought a child into this world with a person who is not an ideal partner for me. I suck the life out of her, I reduce her to nothingness because of my own anger, hatred and self loathing. And it's to say she's undeserving of it, I feel like one person having to pickup after three because she's always out instead of tidying up at home. If I just shut up about it, my OCD would just have me quietly always walking around my house picking up something she left somewhere or my toddler left somewhere. We don't even have space to put a lot of the junk we have. But I can't throw it away because she attaches value to everything. 

We got into a big fight this week after being good for the last few. I ended it when I asked her what I get if I keep forgiving her and letting her trample on me. I asked her whats in it for me. Her only response was the same shitty relationship I have. I want to check out so bad right now. It's less difficult to explain that a parent killed themselves because they were sick than it is to explain a parent isn't around because they're depressed and angry and hate the world. Folks won't have to make excuses for my absence.

I’ve definitely been that person that thinks, “What happened to them that they can’t get their shit together?”

My brother died when I was 19 and while there was depression related to that, it was ‘understandable’ and ‘acceptable’. I have never before experienced the heavy blanket that just crushes my “liveliness” and makes me want to sleep my life away. 

I am much better now. I aggressively reached out for people in my church and threw myself into volunteering efforts. But I know this is not a recipe for all. 

I experienced the perfect storm of post-Covid depression, a recent move and huge distance from my support network. Fortunately I recovered quickly. 

To those that chronically suffer- it is a terrible burden. I am so sorry for your pain. It’s not in your head and you deserve just as much compassion as those with visible ailments.

I’m surrounded by people with a perfect life but in reality, it’s not. Everyone goes through stuff but most people try to hide it. Everyone has had or has a bad mental state and still many live but sometimes I feel like giving up. 

I try to do better in school but I have no motivation left, I try to make friends but I miss my old ones, I try to make my family happy but we fight constantly, I try to cry but I can’t, I try to be happy but I can’t, I try to love but I always tend to regret it later. I’m so sick of all the drama but peace is too boring.

There is always a ‘but’ in the way of everything and it’s driving me crazy. 

Trauma is my biggest fear even if that’s what I’m used to.

I try so hard to get a perfect life but everything is holding me back. 

I want to look perfect, I want to have the perfect grades, I want the perfect personality, I want the best mental state and I want the perfect friends and it’s so hard to get all those things even though it sounds easy. 

A perfect life is unrealistic for a person but it’s what we all want, isn’t it? 

The older I get the more I miss my past even though my life is getting ‘better’ i just feel like I will never get used to the updates. I remember all the times I’ve laughed and smiled without faking it and the times I’ve genuinely felt happy but now it’s like nothing makes me happy.

All I do is worry about my own life constantly and I don’t know how to change that. 

I imagine myself living in a cabin all alone with no cellphone and no electronics far away from everyone in the middle of nowhere, that’s the life I want but I’m scared of missing my old life. 

I don’t think the problem is with this world we live in I think it’s more about my feelings. I’m mentally exhausted. 

It is so easy to help other people but helping myself is so hard and it doesn’t make sense.

I need help but I’m scared to open up. I’ve had some pretty messed up experiences but still, I tend to mess up. I never learn and all that’s left is a ton of scares. 

No one knows what I feel and what I’m holding back from everyone. I don’t know anymore. I just feel like it’s pointless to even try at this point. It sounds so cringe but I bet loads of people can relate.",depression,2021-12-04 18:35:34

i dont even know where to start all of this, now when i decided to write it all down my mind is completely blank, i am so sick of even existing. i am not suicidal nor do i plan to kill myself, i still have slight hope in myself that there is a reason for this happening and that me understanding why is just around the corner. that is what keeps me going, i guess. or i became so miserable that i have no energy to even kill myself. i dont even know. i know nothing. right now i am laying on the couch, 27, in a country of which i do not even know the language nor one living soul here. why? because my boyfriend made me prove his loyalty to him and i was ready to do absolutely anything to be like this for him, and of course, expecting the same in return. but i never got it in return. and i just want to know why? i have no family, my parents broke off contact with me 2 months ago when i wqs begging them for financial support just so i could have for my basic needs and wants and they did not want to help me. i grew up with a narcissist mother and very violent father, i have lived with my parents until 25 because at that point my mother manipulated me to the extent where i thought that this is all i deserve from life, being home, with my parents, every atom of me being controlled, not allowed to go out with certain friends because i was threatened that they gonna kick me out if i do. my father beat me physically until i was 17/18 to the point of such soreness that i could not walk for days at a time. but it was all i had, few times i tried to tell to my grandparents about it and i got kicked out from my parents house. my grandparents gave me a car - my parents sold it and took money for themselves, threatened me if i say anything to my grandparents that i will be kicked out. i did not hear “i love you” from them since i was 8. constantly making fun of me, of my weight, of how i look, of my hair on “unfeminine parts” of me, pimples, everything. i remember when i got my first period and i was so scared to tell it to my mother so i have stole her tampons, she noticed, forced me to strip naked in front of her and beat the shit out of me because i did not tell her that i got my first period. they used to lock me up in my room for hours everyday, go out and return home 30mins before my school started and let me out of my room to go get ready. i dont even remember 90% of my life because i forced myself to forgot. when i was 17 i got my first boyfriend, the first person that i liked and felt something for (just a highschool love, looking back now its funny) which with who i stayed for a year and a half, he cheated on me multiple times, called me in the middle of the night how he fucked some girl that lives 500km away from us because i did not want to fuck with him, and how it is my fault, how i am ugly and disgusting and that he had no choice but to cheat on me. foolish of me for even staying a milisecond with him, but i never had any self respect based on what i had with my parents my whole life, i thought once again i deserve this. friends always used me up for money (my grandma was giving me money for getting As at school) and it was my only way of keeping friends. they knew it, i knew it. fast forward to being 25. i have met such a wonderful guy online, it felt surreal, it felt like my patience and suffering has finally paid off and i got over it, i thought this was my reward for everything bad that ever happened. and what happened? i became obsessed with him, with his existence, with everything that he was saying that he was. he was all i ever wanted, at least presented himself as that. i was a virgin, he was a virgin too - which was very important to me, because i grew up in a household where my parents were first to each other and have spent their lives together, i was blamed to be a whore everytime i would hang out with my male colleagues from school or from neighborhood and i developed a fear of doing anything with man that i do not plan to spend my whole life with. and my ex cheating only intensified the importance of this to me. and i was so happy, finally someone who is the same as me on that topic. it took me 4 months to meet that man, i was terrified of any sort of rejection, i was terrified of my stretch marks, of my saggy boobs, of pimples - who looks like that at the age of 25? its a disgrace. i never in my life felt feminine or wanted. but he accepted me, we started dating, everything was going good until we moved in last year november. since then i have found out that he has, or had, i dont know what is true anymore, a serious porn addiction while talking with me, looking me in the eyes and for months telling me how disgusting and degrading it is, skipping every half naked scene of the movie because “he does not want to see that”, i told him many times without even knowing he has addiction that i would not mind if my boyfriend watched porn - and yet he still lied to me months and months and months on going about it. admitted that he was watching it at work and jerking off to it (spending all of his megabytes on the phone on it and because of that wasnt able to talk with me because no internet), how he watched it at home while i was in bed. we had sex everyday multiple times and did everything that was wanted and needed. today i found on his old phone a whole bookmarks category with folders called - new tier 1, tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 full of different pornstars, folder with skinny girls, folder with black girls (he claims that he is racist the whole relationship), step dad/dad/mom category and i just feel like i have been with an animal until now. he is just peacefully sleeping in our bed while i am crying holding onto my last straw in the living room asking myself why? why am i here again? since we moved here, he lied about his female coworkers, he was meeting her everyday, eating with her alone, meeting with her alone, keeping her as a secret away from me. he made me change my phone number - i did. he made me delete and block my years long friends from league of legends - i did. i moved into another country because of him where i do not know the language and because of corona finding a job was impossible. i am here stuck in a loop, i feel like i am in hell. i really do believe that i am in one. and i cannot anymore, i cannot for months anymore but it doesnt go away. he forced me to hate everyone so no one is a threat to him and to our relationship - and now after 2 years my brain is programmed to hate everyone. i cannot stand one living creature on this planet. i go out and i despise every woman that i see because i believe that my boyfriend would instantly cheat on me with her if he could. i caught him shamelessly staring at other women in front of me so many times… i feel threatened by his every talk with a woman, coworker, retail workers, post, anyone. everyone is a threat to me and i hate everyone that makes me smile and laugh and give him something that apparently i cannot give to him. yes i know that i am mentally ill, but it was a result of all the events that happened to me through my life. i feel like i am going insane, i avoid people as much as i can, i try my best not to say a word to anyone, i avoid even sitting next to a male in a tram/bus. all i ever wanted was to be all to someone, to be enough and to be worth of everything. yes i do know that i have nothing to offer because my will for life has died long time ago, but dont i deserve to be free and released from all of this? i hate myself, i hate every atom of my living body. i am bad at so many things and i get discouraged by every small inconvenience. i cannot anymore… i really cannot… there is so much more to this and if anyone wants to talk with me in depth or help me - please, please help me. i am at the point where i have to beg this from strangers on reddit. i didnt know where and to who else i could turn to. there is much more to what my boyfriend did to me but right now my mind is too scrambled to even think straight. i will write it later or explain it to people if anyone gives me a chance. i just cannot leave him, i have nowhere to go - my parents dont want me and i dont know anyone else. i have 200 euros on my bank account and i own barely anything. i live in austria and i do not know german and have been struggling with finding a job - i had few opportunities and 3 of them wanted for me to have sex with them in order to get a job, because i guess mens mindset is that i was already miserable enough to do that just for the sake of the job. then new lockdown, then more of the bullshit, it is impossible to find a job. i genuinely do not see a way out of this. what am i supposed to do? i cry and cry and cry, and cry more, i am surrounded by mess, uncleaned dishes, onvacuumed floor with barely any food left in the fridge. i have no energy or will to exist. why would i even? how do i get out of this? please someone help me, i am lost and i am scared to live like this my whole life, i can barely get through the day anymore. someone please help me, be it mentally, through talking, financially, any type of way, please…  there is much more to this than i wrote, i am just in so much pain and i dont see myself being able to survive one more day, my heart sinks so deep in my body and hurts so bad, i tried to convince myself that i can at least love myself but how can i if no one ever even tried to love me? not even my parents, not anyone

MULTIPLE doctors have told my parents I have severe depression and anxiety. But they still don't see it. If they kick me out I literally have nowhere to go. If I'm such a burden who would want me in their house anyway. I've already had small relaspes since rehab, but every day I want to use.

My mom knows I have depression. I've had it for the longest and I think it's started to have a deeper affect on me than before. Problems that didn't exist the previous year are now manifesting, like me confusing left for right and saying something completely different from what I read or what my mind intends for me to say. Long lasting problems have pursisted, problems that makes me either overthink or think too little and it lessens my skills of paying attention to my surroundings, following instructions correctly, recalling events and information, and comprehending certain conversations. My mom is aware of these problems and is very quick to calling me out for misunderstanding certain instructions and tasks. I notice these problems pursists when I'm around her, and it feels like I have to walk around eggshells to make sure these problems don't happen or else I'm going to awaken the Gordon Ramsey inside of her. She often complains how many times she's had to correct me on certain things and even yells, ""I REFUSE TO BELIEVE MY SON IS THIS MENTALLY CHALLEGNED TO UNDERSTAND THIS BASIC, SIMPLE THING!"" I've told her many times that these problems are hard to avoid, and it's not like I'm conscious to what I'm doing wrong. It's something outside of my control and at this point, after all these years of making the same mistakes, this is something I need to talk to a specialist about, because I believe it's either my depression or a mental disorder or two preventing my mind from working at times. My mom says the same thing in response, ""Okay, your medical insurance should cover seeing a specialist/ Okay, we can look into doing that/ Okay, we need to find some specialists in the area that you can talk to."" 

Despite this, she's still quick to call me out for these same problems and still treats them as if I'm conscious to avoiding them even though I'm not. She does nothing to help me find a specialist despite what she says and I think it's on purpose. You see, my mom is physically and emotionally abusive. I've endured a lifetime of abuse. This is a mom who threatened to stab me with kitchen knives as a discipling tactic when I was 8-13 years old. Not even for discipling, but for anything. If I had a stomache and I cried too much, she'd tried to shut me up with the knife. If she believe I'll say no to something, she'll use the knife to make sure I say yes before trying anything else. This is a mom who scratched my neck, punched and slapped me and threatened to call the cops on me despite her doing all the abuse and me trying to move away from her. This is a mom who publically berated that 'she hated me and I should go live with my deadbeat father.' If I did see a specialist, I think one inevitable question they ask is what's my relationship with my mother like? And recapping all the abusive stories would get my mom in trouble after years of her getting away with it. If she's not worried about getting in trouble, then I believe she just doesn't like the idea of me possibly talking about her behind my back. Whatever the case may be, it feels like my mind is deteriorating everyday and I'm tired of having these problems being treated as if they're something I'm conscious to recognizing and avoiding, especially being around a mom who's so quick to jump on you before mistakes even happen and provoking anger in you. She's what leads to misunderstandings most of the time, not wanting to make herself understandable nor approaching the way she says things to be understood, and my brain is poorly adjusting to it or something? At this point, I feel like I need to act crazy in order to get her to take me to a specialist or something. Even if I need to break shit and even get arrested as a way of telling her 'THERE'S SOMETHING MENTALLY WRONG WITH ME!'",depression,2021-12-04 14:00:41

745,r8nuft,Am I beyond real recovery?,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8nuft/am_i_beyond_real_recovery/,0,"Hey all.
I wanted to gauge how messed up I really am by telling my story for people;

I was raised in a regional area of Australia
I had a cousin whom I was very close to die from a rare form of leukaemia in his mid 20s when I was 13.
It was a very long and painful death for him and I was there to witness the worst of it.
It made my father's drinking even worse, and my mother left - and because of all this I dropped out of high school and went into home schooling until the mandatory year 10.

Because we lived in a lone house, in a paddock, well outside of town my social interactions were severely limited and it was pretty much just me and my father there until I was 18 and managed to get out on centrelink (the dole) as a full time student.

Those 5 years were very damaging I feel - and even now at 30 I can't seem to escape the grasp of what that time alone did to me.

I was in Melbourne during all the lockdowns (most locked down city in the world apparently - over 270 days) it brought back a lot of that emotional intensity in me and has left me feeling deeply alone and antisocial,  and just worn down (plus broke).
I have had the good grace of a wonderful therapist and the government subsidy, but most of that was just like a kind of emergency first aid to calm me weekly or fortnightly and I never got to make as much progress with it as I would have liked.

I have a deep deep hatred in me for my mother abandoning me and my father for a whole list of things (keeping me trapped for one thing) so my relationship is non-existent with dad, and my mother tries, but I just can't let her in (I've had the term ""ambivalent attachment "" used by my therapist on this)

I feel like I'm at the end of my tether and now the last of my youth is gone and I spent most of it just trying to survive with my overbearing mind so I see myself as woefully under accomplished compared to so many of my peers.
(I have friends and an ex gf from when I studied who have done some truly incredible things since my time knowing them)

I'm skipping a couple of other things in here but that's the meat of it essentially.

I just don't know.
Would love some thoughts from people on all of this.
Thank you.",depression,2021-12-04 17:02:45

My family seems to hate me, and my friend acts disinterested in the things I have to say. Besides my one friend, I don’t have anyone else that likes me. I currently go to school and have a job, and no matter where I am I feel so out of place. It’s gotten to the point where I avoid going out of the house unless I absolutely have to. I don’t like being in public because I don’t feel like I belong. It’s almost embarrassing for me to be around others. When it comes to learning I try so much to do well but it’s hard for me to motivate myself to do it. I wish I cared about doing better in school but I don’t have anything to look forward to. It feels like everyday is the same and its so tiring. I don’t know if it’s my mind or what but it feels like no one ever wants to willingly reach out to me first. Almost no one talks to me during the school day. I see people all the time being able to easily connect with others and I just don’t understand why I cannot do the same.

You’d think I’d let go of this entire situation by now (December), but not really… the reason why I hold on is because her and I’s friendship meant a lot to me, but now if anything now I sort of feel resentment for being mistreated by her in the first place... Maybe writing this will help me let go. I am hoping for some opinion or feedback of some sort.

So this year has really pushed my emotional limits to their max. Over the course of the past 2 years I have lost 4 loved ones to death... turns out I had one hell of a time letting them go (I never lost loved ones throughout the course of my life). I live out of state from the majority of my family to build my career and some day I plan to return with more experience. With the pandemic happening I never got to attend any of their funerals due to the fear of potentially making my other loved ones sick with it (I worry about their health and my own, I also simply did not want to be a reason my other loved ones got sick) and due to some restrictions my job had imposed to prevent the spread. Basically, I never got the closure I personally needed... 

# What happened:

After receiving my vaccination for COVID, a friend of 7 years and I scheduled a trip to visit with each other. I should point out right away that I loved her… I had feelings for her (which may have scared her away idk) which I simply just wanted to reveal to her, whether something came from it or not didn’t matter too much because I waited for perhaps too long to say anything about it.

I live out of state from her (my friend) and my family. I did take a vacation to go see them all. When I witnessed the resting place of my 4 loved ones who passed, it depressed me quite a bit. This was just a couple days before the trip my friend and I took planned out.

During the trip, things went ok for the majority of it, but towards the end is where things began to crumble. See at the time I had a fear of rejection (the fear was strong enough to be scared of even the assumptions I had). I cried myself to sleep that night not only because I was grieving from missing my deceased loved ones but also because I started experiencing a post-traumatic stress episode of traumatic things that happened in my past... lets say I didn't choose to grow up within a dysfunctional family. Never has this happened to me before. Literally felt like my past came back to haunt me mentally in addition to the grief I was already feeling. 

I know she saw me in this depressed state and she didn’t help me in any way, although she didn’t have to, but a good friend would ask what’s wrong right? The next morning I did attempt to tell her my feelings while being emotionally overwhelmed (crying) and she spoke harshly towards me telling me I was too stuck inside my head with a rude tone of voice. Like she was disappointed by me being this way. This made my depression so much worse. With as much pain as I was already feeling and that on top of it, I acted back defensively with what felt like instinct. (I didn't physically hurt her by the way, let make that clear). This eventually led me to ending the friendship out of projection (I felt like a unworthy friend so I thought I'd may as well get it over with), She took what I said fully seriously (which is understandable I guess). I regretted saying this with all my heart and made it known to her not very long after (a couple hours). I don't think this would have happened if she was more understanding of what I was experiencing. I wasn't crazy, I was hurting.... a lot.

She lectured me which eventually led us to arguing with each other. She didn’t act like she was on my side but maybe she was trying to help. She only made my depression worse. Basically, she started a fire. Thing is, it seemed like she tried to put this fire out, but she couldn't (made it worse) and well eventually just ran away and let it burn (let me put out what she started), Telling me to get help as she exited and blocking me from pretty much everything while at it. She made me feel like complete crap, made my already existing depression worse, made me feel stupid, made me feel significant.... like less of a man. Left me in a very depressed state to the point where I couldn't eat for days, self-care was a huge challenge and keeping my place clean was also a huge challenge. The little motivation I could scape up from the bottom of the barrel was used to keep from losing my job and the life I worked so hard for the past 7 years to achieve. I didn't want it all to fall apart. 

I did seek help have been sticking with it for the past 6 months (therapy). At first I thought it was all my fault, overshadowed with overwhelming guilt but now I see that it was my depression taking me over. Gradually, as I healed (6 months of therapy later), the more I realized that she played a part in all this (making my depression worse). It almost seems like she wanted to end it anyways, but then again… I think she didn’t realize what she was actually doing and neither did I. I’ve seen the best in her and I believe her and I are fully capable of putting it behind us, but she's currently handling it in an immature way from what I've heard from other friends and some family.

I want to believe what happened was perhaps a misunderstanding. I didn’t intend any unethical behavior, but that’s just how depression can affect me I suppose. It was scary. Negative thought after negative thought. Thoughts shape your reality. I feel ok today with the occasional depression spell (they are not as serious as they were at the beginning, best wishes to those who feel this way as a living... you deserve the best). My feelings for her persist because of hope, but I'm starting to see all my efforts of having a chance of reconciliation as hopeless. I feel wronged for being a human with emotions... sure I didn't handle it super well but neither did she. I at least tried to fix things. Getting over her has been perhaps the biggest challenge of my life and I still have not done this entirely. I'm working on becoming a better person. I'm working on healing and working towards what makes me happy. I've learned a lot during these past 6 months. I just wish she was still my friend. It has been a very overwhelming road to recovery. 

I only wish she would talk to me to overcome this potential misunderstanding because I do miss her and friendships of 7 years don’t always come and go as they are very rare. I don’t know what went through her mind, but I know pain was only going through mine.

# The Questions

What do you all think? Do you think I should attempt to reconcile? Or should I just move on entirely?  Maybe I’m just afraid to grow and I just need to be told this.  At this point though I do feel frustration and some anger for being wronged like that. I want to confront her and call her out for treating me like dirt and for what she has done and I am very tempted to next time I return back to my home state (no violence btw) to get it off my chest and put out the last flame. I think it would help me get over her but I also don't think its the best solution and I could use some advice. Do you think she needs to be called out for putting an old friend down to the lowest he has ever been in his life? 

 Any help would be greatly appreciated!",depression,2021-12-04 15:03:32

Every night i just think about how trash I am how I'll always be a joke and how no one will take me seriously and I will always be someone to ridicule, to treat with disdain, someone disgusting, repugnant.

And it just completely saps any motivation out of me. All i think about is how useless anything is and how I'll always be seen as this ugly goblin, I guess I could be a fucking ugly gnome too.

Hey everyone, hope you're all doing okay!

Yesterday I came to the realization that I might be depressed without having been aware of it, if that is even possible. I showed egocentric behaviour yesterday but I'm pretty sure I'm not because I feel empathy towards people all the time.

I have a narrow focus. If I focus on something I forget most other things going on in life at the same time. I think this is why I have trouble with memory too. 

Yesterday my gf and I were together for 6 months. We were making plans to hangout in the evening but because we couldn't do it at her place it meant I'd have to pick her up and bring her back which is a combined trip of 120km's. As I have been careless with my money for far too long and have been driving way way way too much I decided I should stop driving back and forth 4 times because if I keep it up it's just going to become way too expensive. Being so absorbed in my finances, I completely forgot about our being together 6 months. Normally that would be a reason to discard saving money and just go nonetheless, obviously. But it wasn't until it was already late in the evening I realized what a stupid fucking mistake I had made. How shortsighted and inconsiderate I had been towards my gf. I feel terrible about it. She doesn't deserve that and she was even being compassionate about me needing to stop being so careless about the amount I drive/spend. I absolutely hate myself for it eventhough it's not something I did on purpose, I just wish I hadn't fucking forgotten. She didn't and doesn't deserve it :( The thing is I was well aware of our being together 6 months, it's the first thing I told her in the morning, yet I'm completely oblivious to it in the evening.

She motivates me to get this problem I have sorted out because hurting her is the last thing I would ever want to do, yet I do it, just not on purpose.

I have a shitty sleeping schedule, and I almost always wake up with a clouded mind feeling dreadful. Even after a perfect night's sleep.

I eat terribly irregular. Sometimes I don't have breakfast or lunch, or both for that matter. I've lost 3kg whilst I have been working out, which means overall I just eat too little.

I lack motivation in my education and I'm experiencing (mostly social) anxiety. I'm the last person to be anxious I always thought of myself but I figured I just changed and am an anxious person now. However, when I talk to childhood friends, my gf, or people I am close with regularly, I am not anxious at all and I am reminded that I used to be like that in every aspect of life. Open, not anxious, extraverted. Nowadays I fuck up conversations with people in the gym because it stresses me out. The person I was is still here but I'm struggling immensely to be at peace with the way I am as of this moment.

I thought these were all just things that changed in me and that I had to fix myself, but I'm beginning to feel like something has to be the cause of this, because despite my efforts I cannot seem to get out of it. 

The struggle has been going on for since before covid and it is dreading me. I'm tired of it, I want to just be my lively self again(, which sometimes comes back for like an hour at random). I want to stop hurting my gf by forgetting things she (and I too for that matter) value. It also makes me feel so selfabsorbed to be busy with my own problems all the time but I feel like I have to in order to fix myself.

What do you guys think? Is there an underlying cause here? Or do I just need to stop thinking so much and start giving my all to get out of this regardless of how it makes me feel? Thanks in advance everyone, stay well.",depression,2021-12-04 13:47:20

I'm a thirty year old male and I have been questioning my sexuality for years. Up until almost two years ago I lived in a very abusive household where I literally lived in a room with the door locked almost all day and night because I was harassed daily by a father who quit his job and retired in his forties and has been last two decades almost sitting around all day and night become irrational and disconnected from reality. I was told he was Bipolar but I never believed it because he never did anything about it. This is a person who literally sits outside of the room downstairs or in the hall until I come out to go to work or school and to verbally and emotionally abuse me twenty four hours a day. In some ways it was like living in the Turpin house if you're familiar with that situation.

His goal was literally to frustrate me so much I would leave and have to be on the street homeless because it's expensive where I am and he knows this was probably going to be my situation. Literally I could have no friends over, not leave for extended periods of time, nor socialize in almost any respect because this was going on in my household or if I was seen with someone it would be brought up.

This started when I was in middle school and went on until I left two years ago almost. My mother did nothing about it and literally lives there still despite being divorced for almost a decade. My other family did nothing about nor anyone else. Almost no one I knows this is how I lived through school and college. It was my problem as an adult to those who had to handle it. I've cut off sections of my family as a result. Needless to say for years I've had massive issues with depression, self-esteem, identity, and otherwise for years. I have really no friends now and moved out as the pandemic started with the isolation and lock down periods.

There was absolutely nothing that brought me positivity each day. When I was nineteen I started to look at porn. Most of it became gay porn because it was literally the only thing that would get me up during the day. It's only certain acts in porn too that I get used to. I had to masturbate just to be motivated to even get up. This created an addiction that has lasted over a decade. I told my other about this issue who is a Christian when I was twenty three. She was somewhat understanding, but never really listening to me on the situation. There were times we argued over it.

For the past two years I've started working on ending the addiction because I moved out. I've never really known what I am sexually. During all of these years I've never had a lust for someone in person, no crushes or infatuates with anyone of any gender, or similar feelings. Over time a few encounters with guys who were interested in me happened at parties and stuff when I actually was able to get out, but I don't reciprocate those feelings. I did it just to see how I felt and actually be kissed by someone, literally anyone because it's never happened and between my past living situation and the pandemic have never been able to find anyone all and spend time to figure this out further. We kissed, it felt hollow.

They gave me some head, also nothing to it and hold me. The times that has happened it's just like two pieces of meat laying together. It's hollow, empty, and similar. I've had no feelings for any of these individuals in any for except maybe a warm feeling after being kissed but it seems to pass after a short time. Is this from doing something instead of being alone all the time? I feel like I only did it to be bicurious and to see what the body contact felt like. It wasn't very interesting to me at all and like I said is pretty much just hollow. I don't get hard during any of this almost either. It's difficult to do to say the least.

It was part of the reason I stopped using porn because I realized I couldn't see myself with a guy. I've never done anything sexually with anyone besides these few encounters. There's never been any form of intercourse because I've never been into it and don't want to do that with another male. It just don't have a desire for it.

During the past six months as I've stopped looking at any pornographic material I've had instances where I will meet a girl for a few minutes and I will think they are pretty almost kind of like I was under a spell where I wanted to talk to them more and get to know them. It's happened a few times now I had never experienced a feeling like this until now. This has never happened with a male. It's like an invisible feeling or spell comes over me and I want to know them more.

I've been able to bring the addiction down to the point where I am no longer actively looking at new porn material and am in what they call the flatlining period where I have no sex drive, but also now depression, anxiety, and similar feelings. I've gotten sick of looking at porn basically and want nothing to do with it.

During that time I've looked at straight porn and actually started masturbating to girls and seeing myself into them. I don't know how to explain this and why this has happened in the ways or order it did. I can't see myself being in a relationship with a male. I have no emotional connection to any of those I've played around with. My instinct is forming a relationship with a female and seeing where it goes instead. I don't think this is just social pressure, but what my natural interest is. I feel like I never was given square odds to see what I am or is going on because there's always been chaos in my life from start to finish.",depression,2021-12-04 13:03:29

I have interesting conversations and thoughts with myself. But I want to share what I like about myself with someone else, and that's never going to happen.

So the only way I have more ""normal me"" time is to prolong the time between the end of today and beginning of tomorrow. Not that it actually increases, but just staying awake through the night would make me feel that the dreaded tomorrow is going to take a while longer to arrive.

Its a very impractical thought and possibly one which would make my life even worse, but I cannot get rid of this idea every night I go to sleep. And I have been noticing the effects.

&#x200B;

I’ll try to keep this short so please bear with me.

&#x200B;

I am a 28 yr old female from rural Arkansas. I’ve been experiencing severe clinical depression since I was 16 or so. It’s always been there, I never had “breaks” or episodes. I’ve had crippling social phobia since about 13 which worsened with age. I developed a binge eating disorder some years ago and went from 110 to nearly 200. Food and sleep only matter. I have had panic attacks and general anxiety for as long as I can remember. I also have substance use issues that have pervaded in my life for over a decade. And best of all, I have what I truly believe is maladaptive daydreaming, which I know isn’t really a diagnosis as of yet. I’ve used this to cope with the isolation and loneliness in life, since I was about ten, I think. 

I’ve spent most of my life in bed, dreaming my life away. I can‘t emphasize enough just how many hours a day get wasted daydreaming about these epic plots and characters that don’t do anything for me except dance in my head.

I have a severely autistic older brother who is counting on me to take care of him full time when my parents pass away. I am barely able to get out of bed. Ive slept so much and been paralyzed in bed for so long that my body is in constant pain. I am always in a huge amount of physical pain. my panic attacks and social phobia make it impossible to get outside at all.

I am so paranoid of being watched and judged, that I imagine someone or something watching me all the time. So it’s even more pressure for me to act on anything. I know nothing is there, but I feel watched nonetheless. I know this is tied to my extreme social fear and not some kind of break in reality.

I’ve been on over 15 medications and went from therapist to therapist. Nothing has ever lifted the pain inside of me. I am scheduled to do TMS treatments soon, which will be a 140 mile drive to the state capital every day for six weeks minimum. TMS is my last hope for a better life.

I’ve done everything I could to make things better, to change things and make life meaningful instead of succumbing to depression. I feel so hopeles. I have worked so incredibly hard. I don’t know what else to do. Am hoping I can stay online enough to make some friends.

This has just started recently and has never happened before. It's getting to a point where I don't want to ask them anything anymore. I'm a freaking adult and they are treating me like how they did when I was a child during the lowest point my of my life.

I don't even think I ask stupid questions. I just clarify what they say because I didn't catch it. They then answer me aggressively like I'm an idiot when they mumble under their breath like I'm supposed to have superhuman hearing/telepathy. I don't. Get. It.

I feel like they're constantly trying to break me down, and it's starting to work. For instance, they would ask for my input for a decision but they've doubted me so many times that I genuinely just go ""I don't know."" Because of this I've begun to doubt myself in all aspects of my life including those few where I used to actually be self-assured.

And this is all a cruel cycle: I do something the way I think is best. Someone yells at me for doing it wrong (whether or not I actually am wrong). Next time I make sure to ask how to do something as to not get yelled at. They get annoyed with me for asking in the first place because ""it's obvious."" Self-confidence goes down, which forces me to ask questions for things I could normally figure out as to not get yelled at again. The questions then get ""dumber"" which gets them even more annoyed and so on.

All this plus the standard gaslighting because my family is way too proud to admit when they're wrong (let alone APOLOGIZE), the hypocrisy that comes with it (ex. getting mad at me when I didn't pay attention to something they said because I'm clearly preoccupied with something, but when they do it to me they're completely justified and I'm just impatient), and assuming the absolute worst about me.

I'm having flashbacks to that awful time in my life where everyone I knew was always criticizing and/or bullying me. I'm reminded why I've become a bitter neurotic perfectionist. Why is this happening all over again?",depression,2021-12-04 02:31:09

About Me

* 28 yrs
* Male
* Indian
* A full time worker
* Quite successful in life, not someone you'd expect to be troubled
* Not a drinker / person who goes out partying although I might drink a glass or two socially 
* Pretty much always been single (had one or two dates fizzled out in a matter of days) 
* Not into just getting in a relationship or plain old arranged marriage, I have built up a pretty kinky side (extended periods of loneliness have left me discovering ) and would like a commitment full of life and excitement
* I feel that I have a lot of love to give
* Wanting to be loved and cared for 
* Considered writing a note so no one blames themselves if I ever decide on drastic steps, and it makes it easier for everyone
* It scares me that I am in a dark place like this


It's very hard for me to place the reasons into words right here and there is alot of backstory or context. 

**In summary:**
* I haven't been able to find a girlfriend and don't have that many friends
* I have a lot of love to give
* I have a tinder account but there isn't anyone to swipe on or match with 
* I can connect with new people easily and be cheerful 
* I see no valid future where am useful
* I belong to a crazy family who raised me wrong and have crazy expectations:
>One believes that marriage is the only thing in life, the other believes owning your own home is the only thing in life (with no knowledge of mortgages)

>Always threatening one of them is about to die

>Primary language at home is screaming 

>Comments by the mother is Service to parents will get you to heaven / otherwise you will get curses

That I'm just doing worse and worse. That my life is a waste. That I am a complete and total failure and that it's too late to really turn my life around and live my dreams. Too late to accomplish anything real. That I am a waste and a disappointment.** 

**I don't even know where to begin or what to say or in what order.** Thinking perhaps I'll just make a list stating facts and feelings. Guess I'll just do that. **Then if something doesn't make sense, you, the Redditors can ask for clarification.** If anyone takes the time to read what I feel will be a novel of a post AND actually comments. **I'm pretty sure no one will want to take the year to read this but figured it wouldn't hurt to put it out there as I am at least venting. Sorry for the novel but that's the only way I can convey how difficult of a time I am having.** Anyway, here it goes. 

* Have only commented on things on Reddit a few times. No original posts. Mostly just come here for video game questions and stuff like that. Reddit is always super helpful and the people seem less toxic than many other sites. 
* I am a **28 year old female.** 
* I **graduated 10 1/2 years ago**. I graduated in May 2011. 
* I've lived in **Utah** since I was only 1 1\\2 or somewhere around there, so pretty much my whole life.
   * **Do not fit in here.** I started dying my hair black in high school, my original hair color is a kind of darker, dull blonde. I got a third ear piercing on the cartilage. I wore tank tops and jeans, still do, it's my favorite thing to wear because it's comfortable. Even as an adult these things are kind of taboo because of how intense the religion is here. So I have stood out A LOT starting in high school. Even now as an adult I'm not accepted because of the same things. 
   * **Feel so trapped and looked down on and alone living in this state.** 
   * **Have a ton of bad memories here.**
   * **Have wanted to move to California since high school.** My dad would take us there every so often because he grew up in San Diego and I have always loved it there. 
      * **I've always wanted to become an actor and moving so Southern California would be advantageous for that as well.** 
* I am **on 2 anti-depressants** and have been for the majority of the past five years. **They barely take the edge off. The edge being wanting to kill myself.** 
* **Have experienced depression and anxiety my entire life.** I thought that was how everyone felt. I had no idea until I looked back and really thought about things or when I have brought it up with people and they said it wasn't normal. The realizations were over the years, starting in high school. I still have realizations sometimes when looking back at my life. Here is one of the biggest realizations:
   * Have had specific anxieties since fourth grade when my best friend told me that she couldn't hang out with me or talk to me anymore because she wanted to be friends with the popular girls. They didn't like me apparently because they said they wouldn't be friends with her if she was still my friend. 
      * I have felt so lonely since that day. My entire life since then.
* **My depression and anxiety have gotten many, many times worse and I now have PTSD. PTSD, not just for one but several events.** Different types and different offenders. Mostly from the two relationships after high school which add up to 6-7 years. The second of the two ended in 2017 but still affects me every day. I have had a few things happen after those two relationships, the most recent being in May. 
* **My depression, anxiety, and PTSD has gotten so bad that I can no longer work.** Starting at the very beginning of October, I finally admitted to myself and even to my Dad and step-mom that I can't function on my own anymore and that I really need help. They helped me apply for state assistance that very night and I now receive food stamps. I am trying to get assistance with rent, applying for disability, etc. since then. 
* **Yesterday I legit started crying when a clothes commercial played on YouTube...** I never ever have money for anything. I still have clothes from high school a DECADE ago with a lot of holes because **I can't ever buy myself anything.** 
   * **A heart condition popped up the autumn after graduating. I didn't know collections was a thing and I wasn't able to pay anything. My credit was DESTROYED before I even used credit. Because of that, I have never been able to take out a loan for a anything ever.** 
      * Obviously, **I don't have a car**, I have never been able to buy one. **I really, really wish I had a car. I never leave my apartment because of my PTSD. I am too scared** to walk anywhere alone and it takes weeks to be able to convince myself to leave and only if I have money for the bus. That is barely less scary for me, but enough to where I can convince myself to leave the apartment if it is for something really important. 
   * My two awful ex-boyfriends are another reason I have never had money. Now it is solely because of my depression, anxiety, and PTSD.
* I have had issues with self-harm since high school. Part of it is the adrenaline high. Guess I am an adrenaline junkie. Thankfully I haven't over the past few years. 
* **I have felt so lonely my entire life, especially now.** People never talk to me first or ask to hang out. It's always me. Hell, I try but no one really wants to. Ever. I have one friend, who has been my friend since high school. But we only hang out 1, maybe 2, rarely 3, times a year anymore. It's been this way for several years. **I have tried making friends but it just doesn't work. I don't understand. Because of this, I have a very hard time having a positive image of myself or have any self-esteem. I feel like something is wrong with me.** 
* **When I really think about it and am having some clarity and a little bit of freedom from the depression, anxiety, and PTSD, I feel that I am pretty, very intelligent, very talented, very strong, wise, loving, caring, loyal, protective, helpful, and sympathetic or empathetic or both (I can't ever remember the differences between the two), good at understanding people and what they are feeling as well as giving advice which almost always helps the person/people.** 
* **But most of the time lately I feel that I am ugly (even to the point where I avoid looking in the mirror at all), naïve, pathetic, failure, waste of space, burden, awkward, unlikeable, sad excuse of a human being.** 
* **I have 3 cats and I don't know what to do** to get financial assistance to pay for their needs. 2 of them are now having issues where they need to go to the vet but I don't have the money. I have considered finding new homes for them but they are the most effective anti-depressants in my life BY FAR. Whenever I think about it I start panicking and legitimately can't continue thinking about it. But I also want what's best for them. But then I think about how some people are terrible to their pets and I get scared. **They are my children, I really do feel that way.** I have had all of them for the majority of their lives. There ages are 11 or 12, 9 or 10, and 2 1/2 years old. **They are my BABIES. They are the reason I keep breathing. They are the reason I keep trying. I am scared of what might happen to my mind and life if I find new homes for them. I'm scared of what I might do.** 
* As I mentioned earlier, **I have always wanted to become a film actor.** While that is already extremely difficult in my situation without taking mental stuffs into play, it's way, way, WAY more difficult with the mental challenges. I don't have any connections with anyone in the business, I don't have any money for college/classes (Of course I could benefit from it but don't NEED it), money for an agent, money to move to a state where there will be more, and better, opportunities. I desperately wish someone could just swoop me up and take me under their wing and help me try for my dream. Someone who knows about the industry or, even better, have experience as an actor themselves. 
   * **I feel like finally getting to pursue and hopefully live my dream would help with my depression.** I think about acting every single day now. The past couple of years it just gets worse and worse. It's driving me nuts. Yes, it's a full time job, but **I really do think I can do it because it is something that I am so passionate about.** 
   * **I haven't really pursued it because it is such a difficult career to break into and thought it would be stupid to pursue and that it would just be a waste of time. But now I feel deeply that it was a mistake and that I need to at least seriously pursue it, that I owe it to myself.** Especially because I am really disappointed in myself for not going for it. **I also think I could do a good job if giving the chance.** 
   * But **I have no idea where to start and researching it has proven difficult with my depression and anxiety. BUT, I NEED to pursue it. It's a need at this point.** 
   * **I am fascinated with all things film making.** Sound, visual effects, set design, costuming, and acting most of all, of course. 
   * I have many reasons that I would like to act. They aren't the superficial reasons that everyone assumes, they are legitimate emotional reasons
   * **I am a gamer and have considered streaming.** Haven't because I don't know if that could somehow have a negative impact on an acting career (probably just being paranoid) and also because I don't live alone and my roommate is usually pretty loud. 
      * Maybe it could bring in some income? I doubt it would get to that point but you never know, right?
      * I feel like maybe it could help me feel less lonely? Which I feel pathetic sharing. I'm just desperate. ha

**As I type, I am always thinking of more things and adding them here and there. As I am starting to feel quite exhausted mentally and pathetic, I will end this here.**

maybe i should drop out and start again next year when i finally muster up enough energy to play a character that vaguely resembles something functional. my dad certainly suggested that, though my brain registered that as a threat. haha, stupid little thing. it keeps wasting money.

on the bright side, i've already started distancing myself from my friends so at least getting left behind won't hurt so much. i doubt it would even affect me at this point since i automatically repress any inconvenient emotions at this point. crying never solved anything after all.

I actually hate therapy. All I do is listen to her go on and on about things I already know. I don’t have problems big enough to talk about, and I’m not at the right point in life to begin healing my childhood trauma just yet. So what do I say? 

I hate who I am. I’m disappointed that I turned into the person I swore I could never become. 

I’ve been through so many lows over the past 5 years. Especially through covid and toxic friendships and family issues. After each low point I’d get marginally better again but I have never returned to my energetic and free state of life.

I just feel numb. I never have any energy at all. I can’t truly enjoy my life, even if I’m seemingly having fun, as I’m just so tired all the time. I’m constantly having existential thoughts. Sometimes I remove myself from my body altogether. I go days feeling like I am in a dream. The world around me feeling blurred. And then I have days when I feel completely normal, however the normal doesn’t even feel worth it. So much energy on… what??? A mediocre life? 

I struggle to stand when brushing my teeth. I struggle to clean. I used to be able to but I just cant at the moment. It’s impossible. I used to be able to think clearly, but everything is foggy and my memory is worse than ever. 

I have incredibly low self esteem. I look in the mirror quite often and just stare. And then I cry. Life is just so bloody hard. Why are we focussed on going through life like every single other person. Shallow relationships. Marriage. Kids. A house and a dog. Like it MADDENS me. Why does this life make no sense?? And I say that with deep love and connection with my dog. And the 2 year old toddler I babysit part-time. I absolutely adore him. It’s not that I hate these things it’s that they feel odd. Meaningless? 

I think I’m talented. I’m creative. I can be fun. I’m extremely compassionate and empathetic. I’m intuitive. I’m sure a lot of people truly would support me. But I feel so insanely unloved. No one notices me struggling every single day. I would oftentimes arrive to school in tears over my life at home and people would ask if I was okay. But no one would follow up. Not even my “friends”. Everyone cares about themselves but don’t seem to notice anyone else. Ever. 

I don’t know what the point in posting this is. I doubt anyone will read all of this nonsense. I’m probably just young and naive and have imbalanced teenage hormones for all I know. However, even if one person could validate these feelings. I may feel a little bit better? Even regardless of my ability to get up every day to work and attempt social life that I am indeed struggling internally. Everyday. A massive weight I carry around on my shoulders. 

Until this year I have cringed at the word depression. I could never have depression. I’m bubbly and warm and caring and somewhat have passions in life. But I lack motivation. I have overwhelming social anxiety. I overthink everything. I feel exhausted every single hour of every single day.

So is that a form of depression or am I just a normal teen? Or is it something else?

My life is complete and utter shit and it has been since I can remember. My girlfriend of 6 years is now gone and that is just the start of my absolute excuse of an existence. I can’t find happiness anywhere, I don’t believe In myself at all, I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate that I use Earth’s resources to keep living this pathetic excuse of a life. I’m an outcast to my family, especially my father. I’m a first gen college student and because of where I’m from I am considered a “hick” by societal standards, so I am often not taken seriously and am seen by the opposite gender as a fucking joke. I graduate next semester and am putting all my bets on any resemblance of a future on getting into grad school, and have decided to put an end to my life if I don’t make it. I see everyone around me, happy, together with a partner, successful, attractive. Then there is me: standing beside myself an empty…ugly shell of shit. I just want to be loved. I just want to fucking matter, but there’s nothing about me that matters. I’m on antidepressants but they only work to remove anger, but the sadness and longing remains. I’m in crippling debt (I used credit to try to buy myself into happiness to no avail) with no chance of getting out of it soon, and I don’t even know how I’ll ever pay back my student loans, especially since my chances of succeeding in my field are clouded by those standing above me.

Don't trust family. Don't rely have any friends. I only have him though he's busy a lot.

Been through a lot, I sometimes have dark thoughts. I feel too exhausted to cry alone.

I feel like a burden even if he assures me otherwise. He's been my rock even if he's younger than me.

Preferably looking for guys no older than 22 in the military or considering enlisting/commissioning.

AD/reserves, boot or a poolie, don't really care but anyone who has the capability of understand my experiences is something I'm looking for.

I need someone from a background who can understand. To make me feel safe thst you are the person I can confide to also

I had a  bit of a realization today in therapy that I actually have no idea how  to really process things like this, which is why I still drag them  around with me.  I meditate, which helps me feel better for a bit, but  then the next little thing that happens might set me off into a spin  out.  I work out, which absolutely helps with my depression and is a  great way to blow off frustration/anger.  But it just ends up always  feeling like a band-aid, and I can't spend my life working out to  address my issues.

I have some  ideas on where to start now: journaling by hand (with gratitude points),  writing music, doing some hobby work, even leaving voicemails for  myself to listen back to.  These seem like decent places to maybe start  but I'm sure there are some other methods out there that might work well  for me.  I also figure that there have to be some other people out  there like me who aren't processing and who might not realize it just  yet.

I guess the reasoning of posting is because I don’t have the understanding of why I live the way I do. 

Why when depressed do I leave my room so dirty? Why be unhygienic and not shower for days on end? 

I’ve currently just been downstairs speaking to family and then came up and looked into my room and was disgusted with how bad I’ve let my room get. Dirty dishes on the floor, my clothes everywhere, my bed only having enough space for me to lay down. The thought crossed my mind of “well you’re up so you might as well clean” but it only resulted in my pushing some items away to lay down in my bed again. I was up, it’s not like there is no lack of motivation there. But I just don’t do it … why ? 

I have to literally go in my calendar to remember the last time I showered. It was Sunday.I have been up, I have been to work, I have met friends. Why haven’t I just showered. 

I don’t like living this way and I wish I could just do it, but the thought of doing instantly makes me feel tired. But I can go downstairs to have a cigarette? I can go downstairs to make a coffee ?

And, well, is it even normal to think about it this way? At the lowest of my low points I've def considered just ending it all.

The fear of knowing that one day this will all be over. That one day the pain and the battle will end, and you will be at peace at last. Except you don't know what peace is, you haven't lived it for so long.  However, illness was part of your routine.  It was guiding you, sort of.  To be at peace is to be free, and to be free is to be without a guide, to be lost, to be either.  Except, again, you never really were yourself. You were a reflection of your illness. But at least you were something.  

If like me you find comfort in pain, then you should know that to tear it away is to tear away comfort. And if you had lived a long time in pain, you know that to stop suffering is like erasing all the moments of pain, that those moments were just a waste of time. Because to move forward, we must forget, ""turn the page"" as they say.  except we don't want to forget the times when we were at our lowest, we don't want to forget who we were, we want to hug them.

Back story - so my ma worked when I was younger say 18 years ago. She got into a car accident and obtained a back injury (crushed vertebrae) she still is able to do all the usual stuff shopping, walking ect. It will only get bad if she really over does it with cleaning or something like that, this will happen once in a blue moon that her back is really bad. She stopped working after the accident and hasn’t done any work since.

She’s always been argumentative and shouts a lot. Since I’ve been a kid this is sort of all I’ve experienced. I don’t think her parents brought her up with love and didn’t teach her to communicate well. 

Anyway, now days all she does it wake up, make a tea, go to the toilet to pluck hairs from her chin, comes down, makes a coffee, sits and watches TV until 11pm and then goes to sleep. This cycle will be occasionally broken by going to the shops for small groceries, cigarettes, or to clean some dishes. Other than this, she does absolutely nothing. 

She has no goals in life, nothing that motivated her or something that she’s looking forward too. The family all booked her a supprise holiday yet she still just sits around with nothingness. And I’m lucky if she cooks a meal!

I’ve tried everything. Ive offered to pay her £100 for a week of her stopping smoking. Tried several methods of cutting down. (Nothing works, she’s doesn’t want to stop) I tell her how lovely she looks and how well she’s doing, if she makes any improvement. Tell her I’m proud of her. Doesn’t really seem to bother her that she’s shaving time of her life. Ive tried to find out her goals in life or what she likes to do. She always brushes it off and cuts me short.

I’m even thinking about getting placebo pills to give her and saying they are good for energy boosting. 

Every time I say anything to her she plays the victim gets angry and storms out.
It’s super getting me down 1 not being able to help her 2 being around someone so unmotivated where I have to do absolutely everything. 

I know she’s going to regret not doing more when she is elderly and actually can’t do anything. Am I being selfish trying to change her? Please help me I don’t know what to do anymore

Can't spend any more time looking at screens and rewatching the office over and over and over. I need real life, real conversations with real people. Human touch. I want to meet people and laugh with them and go places with them and be part of a group of any kind. I tried to go out skateboarding the other day but the park was locked.

My thoughts are just getting worse and worse. I am getting more and more angry at ym flatmates for coming home late drunk and loud. I'm feeling frustrated about money, the clothes I wear and how I look. I stopped myself walking into a specific shop the other day because I felt I was too unattractive to go in. Why do I think like that? I see myself as so big and wide. It feels so mean to make other people look at my face and body, so I cover it up.

I try to distract myself from thinking about how many animals get killed every second in my country for food and I start to feel sick, it's always at the back of my mind and the sounds from the videos I saw of it won't leave my mind. I want to wake up and be a child again, have my parents together and with a normal relationship with my brother. I'd be happy I think. Always had a purpose, no money or working or worries about anything uninteresting. I just don't know. If anyone's somehow read this far just thank you so much.",depression,2021-12-04 04:23:01

i have a job, live with my grandparents (who i rely on, since i cant do anything on my own) and no friends at all. i feel like a burden to my family, to the company i work at, to coworkers, to anyone really. ive told my boss about my depression due to a breakdown and all he said was ""just be happy, smile more"". ofc, why didnt i think of that! easy for someone else to say. last year as a christmas present, i got a talk w him where he said if i dont socialize more he thinks theres no point in having me work there. he seems to have forgotten and pretends that didnt happen. 

i just cant forget it. i remember every word. it hunts me like all of my past does. theres no escape. its just another proof that im truly useless n theres no point. ive become so afraid of failures, but i just cant seem to avoid them no matter what i do. ""you're expressionless, why r u always so down, why dont u talk more, smile more!"" are things that keep repeating. n thats just the external part of things.

internal im extremely tired, cant sleep or sleep way too much. eat a lot less or eat way too much. cant keep a clean streak from cutting. cant cry when i am thinking about all this, but cry in situations where theres no obvious reason. i dont brush my teeth, i only shower when theres someone forcing me to, i dont brush my hair, im literally disgusting. my grandparents always mention what id do without them. i dont want them gone. i cant do anything alone. i dont have hobbies or anything to cope with. im just alone. i lost all my old friends. they dont text me. they just have better people to be friends with. no matter if irl or online. 

i feel like once my grandparents are gone im gonna be gone aswell. theres no point. ill just rot alone anyway.",depression,2021-12-04 04:20:54

I'm new here and my native language is not English so I'm sorry if I say something wrong.

I think I really am at rock bottom.

Do you know when you feel that nothing has more effect on you? Not good or bad? My journey through depression got more intense at the end of last year, but it was far from terrible. At least I still enjoyed small things.

In the past, I used to love reading, especially fantasy books. I screamed with happiness in my room to see sapphic couples having a happy ending on my favorite series. I was fun, communicative and loved going to parties. I was romantic and always had a secret crush on someone. Always super excited.

Over time, I became empty. And I hate myself for it.

I don't get excited about anything. And when it happens\[rarely\], I try to hang onto that thread of happiness because it's the only thing that makes me feel something. It always feels like it's going to last forever, but it doesn't.

I feel like I can't pay attention to anything. I feel tired ALL THE TIME like i'm gonna faint and die. I hate it I hate it so much.

I hate my looks, my personality in general too.

Nowadays, I have zero concentration and motivation to read a book that I internally WANT to read, but I don't WANT WANT to read. Do you understand? I mean, no motivation. But I want do it, so I feel anxious about it but I can't.

Even my desire to have a relationship with someone or even sexual relations no longer exists. Like, nothing. Nothing at all.

I abandoned all my friends because I can't even hold a conversation with them. I can not. Nothing holds my interest and nothing seems to matter.

It's like I'm useless. I can't concentrate, I can't be more creative, I can't like anything, not anyone or even sex.

This years, a lot of times, I thought I was asexual (not that asexuality is associated with any illness, but I believe that a lack of sexual and even romantic attraction can be one of the symptoms of depression \[which is clearly not an isolated symptom and comes with many others\] for some people. ASEXUALITY IS VALID, just to make it clear).

I am a person who was amazing and relatively happy and who is now living on autopilot.

And so I never went to therapy. I promised myself I would go, but I still haven't.

So, I know none of you are an expert, but I would like to know your opinion (based on your mental health life experiences) if you think I might have depression/anxiety?",depression,2021-12-04 00:07:43

I spend all the time I’m not working staring at screens. Mainly my phone. I woke up over an hour ago and have just been scrolling on my phone. My screen time is so embarrassing. I mindlessly scroll through Reddit, Tik tok, social media for endless hours until I am forced to get up for work or I am hungry. On that note, I’ve developed a horrible relationship with food. I eat whatever I want with no self control and there was a time I wasn’t like that at all. I’m always playing video games, playing on my phone or watching YouTube videos. The simplest tasks like taking a shower sound like hell to me and I procrastinate everything. I don’t want to do literally anything. All I ever want to do is sit inside and stare at screens. There’s so many things I want to try to do but I just don’t have the motivation or energy to actually take the steps to do it so I just sit around all day. 

I’m completely dopamine addicted and I don’t know how to feel normal. I don’t know how to have a healthy relationship with food and screens. I am always tired and irritable. How do I take baby steps to overcome this? Therapy isn’t an option as I live paycheck to paycheck and I have no insurance. I think it’s funny that when I did have a great therapist, I wasn’t nearly as depressed. Joke’s on me.

927,r8a7st,In Need of Some Opinions,1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r8a7st/in_need_of_some_opinions/,0,"Back at the start of September (3 months ago), I started having some really weird neurological symptoms that developed over the course of a few days and haven't really gone away fully.

The most severe symptoms back then were:- Intense brain fog / derealization- Irritability and depression- Lack of appetite (I lost 10-15 lbs)- Fatigue- Sore legs and back

A lot of these symptoms are similar to the traditional symptoms of depression, but the way that this rolled in out of the blue without any noticeable causes in my life (nowhere to point to regarding the depression) makes me think that something happened or that I got sick or something.

The most concerning symptom and feeling that I can't shake is this derealization sort of feeling where the world feels 2-dimensional and fake. It triggers me to think about it and it makes me deeply depressed when I feel it because I don't know if I'll ever feel normal again. Sleep is the only relief I get, but I usually awaken with this feeling of impending doom, so I never get the enjoyment of awakening feeling rested.

I find it hard to stay on top of my fitness, hygiene, and appearance. Things that I used to care a lot about. I feel very disconnected from my passions and lifelong dreams (music production and creativity). Overall, I feel disconnected from everyday life and humanity.

After seeing my doctor a few times, we ruled out a lot of things and are currently pointing to COVID long-haul, as the symptoms seem to be similar. I also took one dose of MDMA a few weeks before my symptoms, so I'm not sure if that could be what caused this.

Regardless of the cause, I'm writing this to get some opinions because I really don't know what to do. When these feelings occur, they totally consume me and make me feel hopeless.  


EDIT: For context, I am 25 years old and I've never had mental health issues before. I've also never taken any meds or anti-depressants, but I'm starting to wonder if they're needed. I'm scared to start one to be honest.",depression,2021-12-04 03:37:18

I don’t think it was my ex’s fault necessarily (we broke up in 2019 right before covid) but we were super incompatible in all aspects of life and really had no busy dating to begin with. Because I was dating someone 3/4 years at college, I felt I didn’t get to have a real “college experience”. After I graduated college and began working in banking. I realized what a mistake I made studying finance as I’m just not passionate about it and it is so mundane (I didn’t have a high enough GPA to get the interesting finance jobs in equities or IB).

She said since I was about to graduate the demon's were trying to make me fail and if I was actually depressed and anxious it would have shown up when I was young. The problem with that is ive told her about this multiple times since 2018 and ive been dismissed every time. I don't know what to do anymore.  I have no motivation and im so tired and the only way I feel better is by sleeping. I feel like most days I have almost no interest in anything I used too do and almost nothing is fun.

It's starting to effect my grades because Im so stressed that I can't remember things. I failed an essay  because I couldn't even remember the book and because I could barely read what I wrote.

I got so upset a few days ago that I almost killed myself, it was like I was having an out of body experience and the only reason I didn't was because I was in the car and I had nothing to do it with. 

Even with all of that im starting to believe that im not really depressed. Because not only did my mom say was fine, Im not sad 24/7 and some days I feel fine/neutral or even happy.

Also, English isn't my first language, but I've been learning it since I was 12 so I guess it's good enough for y'all to understand hahaha. First of all I just wanna tell y'all some info about me:

\- My name's Luna- I'm turning 22 in a couple of weeks.- I have lived with my boyfriend & his parents from the beginning of 2018 - april- In may of 2018, me and my bf started to live together in an apartment where we are still living as of today (and our 2 cats!)- I've been to a therapist from 2019 - 2021

I have been depressed from 2018 to, I think, 2021, or maybe halfway 2021. It's so hard for me to name a specific date or month when I felt like my depression was 'over'. I mean, it's a very very slow proces of course. Also, the pandemic started which caused a lot of mental problems for me and a lot of other people so that just kinda feels like an extension of my depression :/

I've been doing great for the past 3 months or so. I keep falling into rougher times once in a couple of weeks where things start to become hard again, but it feels like the period between me doing well and kinda slipping back into old habits gets bigger and bigger, and the duration of the harder times gets smaller. Which is great!

Even tho I don't feel those horrible feelings anymore, they're still in my head, and the only thing for me to let them out is my writing poems. I've been doing that since 2016 and whenever I feel very sad I write until my sadness is gone.

Now my 'problem' I wanna talk about is this: sometimes I feel like I miss my depression. It is as if the time where I was depressed, was a time of 'peace and comfort???????' even tho it was a horrible time where all I wanted to do is not live anymore. I did not wanna die, I just wanted to be in a state of sleep, but then 24/7 instead of 8 or 9 hours. My world was just so so small. I slept for hours and hours each night, didn't eat at all, maybe around 700 calories and I didn't see any people bcs i quit school. I cried so much, until my head felt so full I just couldn't cry anymore. I just waited for my bf to return home because he was the only thing that could make me happy, even if it was a tiny bit. I feel like I wasn't a person, I was just a lifeless human being trying to survive while being stuck and drowing in her thoughts 24/7. (Writing this feels weird and it feels like this wasn't me or this was a lifetime ago)

I don't remember much about those times. My head feels so fucking foggy and big chunks of my memory are missing. I hate it but also I think it might be some kind of protection from my brain to not do any more mental damage then it has already done to me.

It just makes me sick to my stomach to even say or think about me missing those times. I've done so much harm to my boyfriend and his parents (both supported me all the way trough my depression & talked to me a lot about it bcs my parents weren't and still aren't there for me. My bf still helps me to overcome my fears and lets me cry in his lap whenever I need to)

Are there people on this forum who have felt or feel the same way? If so, do you know why you feel like that? What do you do to deal with those feelings?

There are much more things I wanna talk about but this is long enough and I'll probably make more posts in the future whenever I feel like I need advice from you guys <3",depression,2021-12-04 02:37:56

I  know that those are pains that will vanish with time and I try to think  of it like that but right now, I just don't know what to do.

Watching  movies or shows doesn't distract me. Gaming doesn't distract me. I  can't focus enough on reading. And worst of all; I got no one to talk  to.

Only work does distract me lately but I have no work days this weekend.

I am scared of how bad the next two days will be. I really need something that can give me some relief from this pain.

With my colleagues, of course we have that teamwork but I can't find anything in common with them.

Random times in the day, I have to have this mask of who they think I am on and sometimes it's too difficult to keep it on..its tiring to always find something in common with anyone, trying to find the root of what kind of person I am, and what is it I love to do. 

I desperately need to speak to someone but I'm afraid my doctors won't believe or think it's that awful that I need to speak to a therapist. I don't have  money to spend on a private on.

I don’t want to hurt anyone, or make anyone feel like it’s their fault. I do everything I can and it’s never enough. Go to work, cook, clean, watch the kids, do grocery shopping, take care of pets, and try to make people happy as much as I can. But those things are never seen.

She got mad at me today because I had to go use the bathroom while she was talking to me. If this is gonna be my life, this constant hatred, I should just go.

Dropped out of school in 20's and she just spiralled . She has always had low self esteem and insecurity problems . She finds comfort in food and eating, she also has a tv show character that she's been obsessed with since she was a teen and she spends a lot of her time daydreaming about them. I think she hears voices in her head sometimes because i see her having conversations with herself and making strange faces and she does this at any time even if she is talking to someone in person. I'm very worried for her, she does not live in reality. I think she has a lot of undiagonsed issues. I an 22 and i have my own mental health problems ...i suffer from depression too but its not as bad as her . She had no job , no friends....no goals nothing. She is literally dead already and just existing . Its a very sad situation , she needs help so badly but my parents dont see it as mental illness...they would never understand. I don't know what is going to become of her and her life. I too am fighting my own struggles but its sad to see someone else just disintegrate before my eyes. Crazy thing is i dont think she is suicidal at least she has never expressed any intent or tried to kill herself. I have done that before but she never has and her life is so much worse than mine. I don't know how she is surving or what keeps her going. Living in her head must be hell on earth ! I am so serious , i wonder what thoughts she has inside her head because i just dont see how she carries on, even just staying alive. She is completely defeated and broken down. She will not get better on her own or anytime soon. I think she is too far gone... its so scary. I thought i was bad and i know you can't really compare struggles but it really puts things into persepective. I think i am lucky enough to have somethings that keeps me tethered to reality , no matter how bad it gets and it has gotten very bad ...like i have a few friends i can talk to...i have some goals i think i want to achieve for myself..i want my life to get better somehow. I dont think she has any of that. She has nothing at all. How can someone live like this? How is this possible? Being human is the most terrifying thing ever , i hate that there are people in this world who have to live like this. I hate that people are just suffering with no way out. Why does it have to be this way? Why are people just put on earth and they suffer all of their life ?? Why?? Why is it so bad for some people??? Is there any reason at all?

We had cps involved a few times, and the type of stuff that goes with that. My mom has what I think is Munchausens, she's always trying to diagnose me with stuff and is willing to come up with whatever lies it takes to get people to believe her. Some do, some don't. Because of this, I feel very isolated from 99% of my extended family along with my immediate family.

 I have two close friends and a few acquaintances, one friend who I have feelings for but I know that's not going to work out for a while if ever. Most people see me as f-able and not datable or friend material. Even my coworkers will want to do that with me, or offer to pay me for... stuff (something I'm against and would not do)

I spend all my time going to highschool, college and working full time to move out of my parents house, and when I get home at the end of the day, I have no opportunity to do anything besides homework, an episode of a netflix show and a half hour phone call to one of my friends. It's a little better on the weekends, and I'm able to spend a few hours with my friends in between work and studying. I get 5-6 hours of sleep most nights and try to keep myself going with coffee throughout the day. I also have a health condition that makes me tired too.

I'd like to get therapy, but because of the way my parents are, I'd like to wait until I'm on my own insurance to do so. 

A lot of people come up to me and tell me I look sad all the time, but it's not an intentional expression, or as a result of me thinking anything sad. I just feel really tired all the time. Right now I don't like my life too much, but I also feel like I'll be able to relax in 4 years when college is over and things will get better then, even if I'm not always happy now. I'll be able to get a nice house, hopefully fall in love and have lots of time to find out what my hobbies are.

So lately ive been depressed, it started in November of 2020 when my dog passed away, i was heartbroken and sad but I tried to power through everyday. Then my mom got a new dog, i didnt like it at first cause i though she was just replacing him. We had her a for a few months and then she died of a heart attack in March of 2021. My mom was devastated and spiraled into depression as well. I tried to help her but I didnt work very well cause I was feeling shitty to. Then shortly after she got ANOTHR dog that passed away in the Summer which made us both worse. I told her to stop getting dogs cause it was only hurting us and she agreed but shortly after she decided to start dog sitting cause she lost her job around tge Summer as well. She enjoys it which in glad for her but she still dosent seem to be getting any better. Then she got ANOTHER dog and hes still with us but im afraid that if something happens to him she'll go off the deep end.

Then there's me, I'm also depressed but my biggest issue is i feel super lonely. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no one to talk to, and im not finding joy in anything. I cant see a therapist cause im on a waiting list to get one so i have to wait. Im lonely as shit and cry myself to sleep most nights cause I just desperately want to be loved but feel so undesirable. And i have no friends, the ones i did have were racsist asshole who i dropped cause they were extremely toxic. Plus im cant stop watching porn and masturbating which makes me feel worse whenever i do it but keep doing it to feel a few moments of happiness. I also cant stop watching these stupid fucking ASMR videos of women being nice and supportive, there really nice but i feel so shitty after watching them cause i know it's fake.

I have no one to talk to cause if i talk to my mom she'll just get worse and i have no friends to turn to. Im just so lost and have no idea what to do with my life. I hesitated to make this post cause i feel like it wont accomplish anything but im desperate so here i am.

I'm a broke wannabe director that has wasted 90% of his life in the religion he was raised in. A lot of family issues, diagnosed with DID, and so many traumas and engrams that I can't even go out on a walk without having a panic attack.

It was okay until Covid arrived, I was able to pay a therapist and all the personalities stuff was under control. I tried so hard, so many times getting my ass into the film industry, and I don't know if I'm a masochist or what, but to this day I'm still passionate about making films. I try to stay focused on other stuff, but no matter what and without even realizing, I always end up with fantasies in my head about being a director and making a living out of what I like, every single second, every single day of my life.

Because of economic reasons, I've been for a couple of months without therapy now, and it's not being easy. My day to day right now is just focusing on surviving, figuring out how to keep myself busy until night arrives. I don't even know who I am anymore. I honestly don't even know who the fuck is writing this right now. I've tried reaching for help, but shit in my life is so fucking hardcore people just will never believe me and think I'm an attention whore. Maybe I am, but I really force myself into thinking that I'm just one unlucky motherfucker struggling with an unusual mental condition.

I had so many meetings with really important people, worldwide known directors and producers, and here I am. Crying in front of a screen because nobody gives a fuck about my stories. As the title says, I don't even know what I'm doing here. I try to follow my therapist's counsel and not thinking about shit my abusing father used to say like ""You're always trying to call attention"".

I know this is going to sound sooooo cliché, but if somebody ever made a movie about my life, people wouldn't believe it. My DID shit is already enough to make people say that ""I've watched too many movies"". I've moved 17 times at the age of 26. I got my face slashed one night by some asshole on drugs. My family abandoned me because of religion. I've almost died a couple of times because of different reasons, suicide attempt obviously is one of them.

I don't think about suicide anymore, or at least I try to. I just want to stop thinking about fucking cinema. I hate it. I fucking hate my passion. I could be the whole day writing about my almost-achievements that ended up being total failures. It doesn't matter how close I get, it always ends up being the same: a slap right in my face and a ""I'll try harder next time"" to myself. Maybe I'm just trying too hard.

I get so fucking mad when I see people that used to be nobodies, that I helped so bad with my contacts, my gear, my VFX skills, and that got to reach really, really high... and now they act like they don't know me. With time, and as high as they get, they all end up ignoring my messages, unfollowing me on social media, and that kind of stuff. Most of them are YouTubers, gotta say. My bad for never learning and still helping others, over and over again, until I've got myself completely burnt.

I guess I'm here in reddit because I feel like I need to be heard by somebody. In my country mental health is pretty under-fucking-rated, and even those who really, honestly want to help you out, will limit themselves to compare you with others who are in a ""worse"" position, they often will put themselves as examples, shit like that. I really miss my therapist.

I'm not expecting anybody to answer me, and definitely I'm not expecting a producer to come out of random and say ""Hey that's a sick story, here's a million dollars so that you can make a movie"". I just need to let it all out and feel like I'm being actually heard by somebody. I just need to be heard, that's all. This is something purely therapeutic for me.

If there's someone curious about psychology or whatever, I'm quite open about questions regarding my condition or whatever. Not like I'm looking for friends, but trying to get all this shit that is burning my head out, stop thinking about smoking 24/7, and being able to focus better on my day to day activities. After all, 3 years of weekly private therapy must have showed me how to, at least, trying to get my head straight and solve problems by myself.

Perhaps I should start with that I see two different shrinks regulary, I take meds and I am somewhat in between deciding if I either go into a psych ward or just end it all.

Ive been struggeling now for over 10 years, it started only mentally, was pushed further by a toxic relationship, bad parenting, brutal 24/7 mobbing. I never had real friends that cared for and all of that together caused crippeling overthinking and trust issues.

Long story short, last year was the absolute worst year of my life. I developed substance abuse problems (I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety, and got hooked, was taking 5 2MG bars per day), best friend of 15 years who was like a brother cut me out of his life, left the woman I was going to marry, and burned a lot of bridges. 

&#x200B;

I turned into an emotional cripple. I didn't care about anything anymore, I didn't care who I hurt or how bad I hurt them. I was completely indifferent. I just wanted to be asleep as much as I could, and when I wasn't comatose from Xanax, I'd be drinking like a fish and smoking weed like a train.

&#x200B;

I've been clean off of Xanax since August, and although you would think that life would look better on paper now, nothing feels quite right. Sure, I'm in grad school, I've got a good job, but life just has no shine to it anymore. I don't look forward to anything because nothing really does anything for me anymore. I used to look forward to going out on the weekends, events, and such and now I just feel nothing when I participate in such activities. I keep thinking ""If I just get \_\_\_\_\_ done, then I will feel fulfilled, happy, and like my old self"" and it just never happens. I accomplish something whether it be getting in shape, making all A's for a semester, or landing my job, it all just feels empty. All of my friendships seem shallow too. None of them ever stick anymore, and none of them seem to go past much of a superficial level.

&#x200B;

Love, and sex mean nothing to me anymore. I get no enjoyment out of dating, in fact, I've grown to loathe it because I always feel pressured to perform sexually, and I just have no sexual desire whatsoever anymore. It all died when my relationship died. 

&#x200B;

Honestly in the past, even when things were at their darkest, I always thought ""Yeah things are bleak now, but I'll bounce back. It's just a rough patch."" It genuinely does not feel that way anymore. This time, it feels like there is absolutely no coming back, no more chances, no apologies, no making amends, no hope whatsoever. I feel like a walking, breathing, corpse. It literally feels like I died and went to Hell, and when I look at old photos, it feels like I'm just an empty shell of the person I used to be.",depression,2021-12-04 01:24:46
